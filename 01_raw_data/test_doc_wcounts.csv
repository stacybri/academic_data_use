59034580,"This study has investigated the relationship among school culture, teachers’ job satisfaction, and school effectiveness. It also explored the mediating effect of teachers’ job satisfaction on school culture and school effectiveness. Participants of the study include1, 297 teachers from 6 lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Beijing, China. Quantitative methods were used for data generation, consisting of 3 questionnaire-based surveys to measure, separately, school culture, school effectiveness, and job satisfaction from the teachers’ perspective. The results indicated positively significant relationships among school culture, teachers’ job satisfaction, and school effectiveness and that teachers’ job satisfaction partially mediated the impact of school culture on school effectiveness. In light of these results, limitations and directions for future research are provided, as well as implications for education. https://doi.org/10.26803/ijlter.17.5.2",1,test,125

Throughout developed countries, the pharmaceutical concentrations in the aquatic environment are in the same range (μg L−1 and below); however, it is not clear whether this holds for less-developed countries too. The health risks of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) remain poorly understood. Although there are no known short-term effects on humans, long-term effects cannot be ruled out until there is more research. The significance of metabolites and transformation products resulting from the parent APIs is not yet known.

55829214,"Nowadays tourism economy is driven by information technology (IT) and telecommunications. All tourism oriented companies, such as tour operators, travel agencies, rental agencies, cruisers and hotels experience the growing impact of what is commonly known as information and communication technology (ICT). Tourism sector represents the information-intensive industry characterized by a significantly long value chain influenced, to a great extent, by information. Its creation, collection, storage, retrieval and transfer remain within the core activities of all tourism enterprises. Every single innovation in IT sector can potentially change the strategy followed by tourism companies in running a business. Such transformations are also imposed by tourists’ behaviors which keep altering under the influence of information technology. The process of tourist services purchase is based on information collected through many different channels, e.g. travel agencies, brochures, the word-of-mouth, or web sides offered by tourist service suppliers, which are currently gaining much importance. Consumer decision making process in tourism sector is transformed into an online one, since direct service booking has become possible. ::: Proper understanding of behaviors presented by those searching for travel information online, as well as using innovative information and communication technologies by tourists, remain essential for designing an effective ICT-based business model. Currently it seems to be the crucial challenge for the entire tourism sector. ICT is focused on designing the new scientific paradigm (by innovation, co-opetition, collaboration with customers) of tourism development based on modern e-technologies. ::: The paper discusses the level of information and communication technologies application in the tourism sector. The study covers small and medium-size hotels (SMEs) and travel agencies which dominate the tourism industry worldwide.

The factor complementarities may take a variety of forms: technological and informational complementarities, as well as economies of scale and scope. We examine the tradeoff between the gains from these complementarities and transactions costs. In so doing, we must abandon the standard dichotomy between the determinants of plant size and firm size. The influence of factor complementarities on firm size is examined in partial and general equilibrium frameworks.",0,test,93

This study investigates how the income tax differentials across communities in an urban area affect the households' location decisions. Data from the urban agglomeration of Basel for the year 1997 is used. This unique data set contains tax information from all households that moved either within the city center of Basel or from the city center to the outskirts. The community choice of the households is investigated within the framework of the random utility maximization model (RUM). A theoretical model with progressive income taxation is developed to identify the household preferences applied in the RUM. Different econometric specifications of the error term structure, such as conditional logit, nested logit and multinomial probit are compared. The empirical results show that rich households are significantly and substantially more likely to move to low-tax communities than poor households",1,test,149

Given that red‐meaning associations may result – at least in part – from background experience, we tested this effect in 51 children. First ( M age = 6.42, SD = 0.60) and fifth ( M age = 10.71, SD = 0.43) graders were asked to choose between sheets of paper with red or green borders to carry out two kinds of activities (i.e., evaluative vs. recreational). Analysis of the results showed that the older children tended to avoid the red-bordered paper for the evaluative tasks, whereas the younger children chose red for both kinds of activities. These findings suggest that context-driven red‐meaning associations develop across grades.",1,test,130

154039004,"Headline CPI, core CPI and indices for various expenditure categories were analyzed. Long-term linear trends have been found in the difference between the core CPI and the headline CPI in the USA. Duration of these periods is different for positive (18 years) and negative (8 years) trends, and the trends change to opposite during some shorter time intervals of 2 to 4 years. The difference between the core CPI and the index for energy is similar to that between the core CPI and headline CPI. The index for energy will reach the core CPI in 2008, however. Then, one should not expect further increase in energy price beyond that dictated by the CPI. It is likely that oil price will be falling in absolute terms. The difference between the core CPI and the index for food also has two linear branches after 1980, but the slope of the current trend is weak and the difference will intercept zero line only in 2014. The difference between the core CPI and the housing index is characterized by an almost constant duration of negative and positive branches i?½ approximately 11 years. The current period of negative slope in the difference will approach its turning point in 2008 or 2009 and is characterized by very high volatility. The next trend has to be positive, i.e. the housing index will be growing at a lower rate than the headlining CPI. The difference for the transportation index had a longer period of positive slope i?½ between 1980 and 2004. During this period the difference reached the level of 30 units of index. Currently, a turning period is observed and a negative slope is developing.

48554130,"Abstract A common strategy for controlling spending is to impose a price restraint on oneself. For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situa...",0,test,149

Pre-term children born low birth weight are at risk for behavioral and emotional difficulties, however, little is known about how these difficulties manifest and interact with biological risk and environmental factors. This study examined the extent to which children’s language and dyadic relationship factors facilitate affect regulation and behavior problems in low birth weight children (LBW). Sixty-eight preschool-age children and their mothers participated in the study. Children were administered an assessment of cognitive functioning in which verbal ability was examined, and engaged in a laboratory frustration task designed to elicit negative affect to assess emotion regulation. Results revealed correlations among verbal ability, behavior problems, behavioral synchrony, and emotion regulation. Group Differences were found in verbal ability and positive affect in which LBW children demonstrated lower verbal ability scores and less positive affect than full-term children. For the full sample, behavior synchrony moderated the relationship between verbal ability and negative emotion regulation. The results provide evidence of the importance of the functional role of language and dyadic relations in the development of affect regulation and behavior problems. The results also elucidate the importance of integrating social emotional information in developing interventions for pre-term children.",1,test,206
155046052,"The gradual march towards the attainment of self-government in Nigeria from the mid 1940s increased the tempo of party politics. The early local champions of the socio-political developments were those who had acquired western education. The role of these emergent elite in forming associations to champion the cause of their people tends to earn them a voice in their grassroots politics. The Kabba Divisional Union (KDU) formed in 1964, which attempted to severe the political allegiance of the area from the Northern Peoples Congress (NPC), and change the political history of the Division was one of such associations. The focus of this work is on the remarkable role of the western educated elite in the socio-political developments of Kabba Division. It highlights the dynamics of socio-political change in Kabba Division. Attempt is made through this discourse to provide a better appreciation of developments at grassroots and regional levels. The paper contends that the failure of the NPC – controlled regional government to seriously enhance the socio-political and economic status of Kabba people in the region, caused a major shift in the political leaning of the people of Kabba Division. The paper concludes that general competing interests not withstanding, the western educated elite in Kabba helped to overcome the traditional isolation of the area by providing the organizational vehicle through which the Division participated meaningfully in the wider Nigerian political system.",1,test,230

182700242,"Objective : To compare the differences in surgical procedures, pathological features and prognosis between young and elderly women with breast cancer in China. Methods : A retrospective study compared the data of surgical procedures, pathological features and prognosis of 61 cases of young females (≤ 40 years) and 507 cases of elderly females (> 40 years), treated in our department from August 2011 to July 2018. This data was analyzed using SPSS 23.0 program. Results : 10.74% of total cases, in this period of time, involve young females. In terms of surgical procedures, 24.59% of young patients underwent breast conserving surgery (8.48% elderly, respectively), and 13.11% underwent reconstruction surgery (1.18% elderly, respectively), with statistically significant differences existing between the two groups ( P < 0.05). Progesterone receptor (PR) expression in young women was significantly higher than in elderly females ( P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), expression of estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and Ki-67, but the lymphatic metastasis stage showed an increasing rate with younger age. No significant difference was found in 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Conclusion : The selection rate of breast conserving and reconstructive surgery in young women with breast cancer is significantly higher than that in elderly women.

No bias in interpretation is observed when the masked prime is a word that is semantically related to the target with no morphological relationship (e.g., glue), though such a semantically based bias is revealed when the prime is unmasked. Because the masked priming results cannot be explained in terms of facilitation of processing at either the form level or the semantic level, it is concluded that an intermediate level provides the locus of the effect, referred to here as the ‘lemma’ level. Thus, any model of lexical processing needs to incorporate such an intermediate level to capture the relationship between stem morphemes and their derived forms.",0,test,136
1478836,"There is a long-standing controversy over the question of whether targeting social transfers towards the bottom part of the income distribution actually enhances or weakens their redistributive impact. Korpi and Palme have influentially claimed that ""the more we target benefits at the poor, the less likely we are to reduce poverty and inequality"". The basic empirical underpinning of this claim is a strong inverse relationship at the country level between social transfer targeting and redistributive impact. We show that this no longer holds as a robust empirical generalisation. The relationship between the extent of targeting and redistributive impact over a broad set of empirical specifications, country selections and data sources has in fact become a very weak one. For what it matters, targeting tends to be associated with higher levels of redistribution, especially when overall effort in terms of spending is high.

150907852,"Abstract : It is a well established axiom that attempting to defeat an insurgency or a terrorist organization head-on is merely treating the symptoms of a problem. For long-term success, the campaign must also address the root causes of the insecurity that spawned conflict in the first place. In this monograph, British academic and practitioner Dr. Shima Keene describes a number of ways in which financial intelligence can be leveraged not only to disrupt adversary activities, but also to provide indicators and warnings of future actions and, ultimately, to address underlying insecurities. Dr. Keene was previously both a banker and a British Army reservist. In this monograph, she uses her expertise as a threat finance specialist to outline specific areas where financial intelligence analysis techniques, which are common in the private sector, can be applied to combating insurgency, terrorism, and other hard security threats. Dr. Keene argues that financial disruption techniques used in counterinsurgency have been poorly coordinated and at times counterproductive, and cites the targeting of the Hawala money transfer system as a specific example. Instead, she notes intelligence derived from analysis of financial data can provide much greater value in both understanding and predicting the adversary s activities, as well as providing for precise targeting to disrupt them. The Strategic Studies Institute recommends this monograph not only to counterinsurgency and counterterrorism practitioners and policymakers, but also to the Intelligence community more widely; all of these will find its conclusions on the handling of financial data and the value of threat finance analysis valuable.",0,test,255

A sample of 602 students from 6 schools (339 males and 263 females) was drawn from the population using balloting technique. The experimental groups were taught with IIS and CLIS while the control groups were taught with Lecture method, in each of the sampled schools. Both the experimental and control groups were taught organic chemistry by their regular chemistry teachers. The instruments used for the study were Chemistry Achievement Test on Organic Chemistry (CATOC), Cooperative Learning Instructional Manual and Learning Activity Package Manual which were validated by three experts. The reliability of the CATOC was determined using K-R 20 with index of .82. The research questions were answered using mean with standard deviation while the null hypotheses were tested using Analysis of Covariance. The findings revealed that both IIS and CLIS significantly enhanced students’ achievement in Organic Chemistry better than the Lecture method, but the CLIS was more effective than the IIS.

11222114,"Encouraging private investment in affordable housing Australia has been recognised as a major challenge by researchers and policy-makers for some time and this has generated considerable work on possible models. One successful model of private investment in the large scale provision of rental housing has been that of Defence Housing Australia (DHA). In 2009, DHA had a portfolio of over 17,000 dwellings valued at over $7 billion that were owned by a mix of public, private individual and institutional investors. Essentially the DHA has a number of functions, it: constructs housing buys housing sells housing (to dispose of it) sells housing to investors (called non-DHA housing in this report) and leases it back on long-term leases manages tenancies maintains houses (including essential maintenance for its leaseback properties) refurbishes housing relocates tenants. The non-DHA properties are managed by the DHA for fixed periods typically up to 12 years and are on-leased to service personnel. The financial and operational parameters of this model has many features in common with intended directions for affordable housing signalled under recent national and state policies—especially plans to promote private ownership of affordable housing and to encourage larger scale housing managers, with a focus on the potential of the not-for-profit housing sector. The aim of the project is very straightforward: ‘to determine the potential lessons of the DHA model for affordable housing provision’. To address this aim, the study will consider the following specific research questions: What are the characteristics of the rental housing investment and business models operated by the DHA and how have these developed and performed across market cycles? What benchmarks can be established for key performance areas including returns to investors and asset and tenancy management? What implications can be drawn from the DHA model for the emerging affordable rental housing sector?",1,test,299

We use logistic regression models by state to estimate the association between insurance status, race, and the likelihood of a readmission within 30 days of an index hospital admission for any cause. Overall in 5 states, non-Hispanic blacks had a slightly higher risk of 30-day readmissions relative to non-Hispanic whites, although this pattern varied by state and insurance coverage. We found higher readmission risk for non-Hispanic blacks, compared with non-Hispanic whites, among those covered by Medicare and private insurance, but lower risk among uninsured and similar risk among Medicaid. Hispanics had lower risk of readmissions relative to non-Hispanic whites, and this pattern was common across subgroups with private, Medicaid, and no insurance coverage. Uninsurance was associated with lower risk of readmissions among minorities but higher risk of readmissions among non-Hispanic whites relative to private insurance. The study found that risk of readmissions by racial ethnic groups varies by insurance status, with lower readmission rates among minorities who were uninsured compared with those with private insurance or Medicare, suggesting that lower readmission rates may not always be construed as a good outcome, because it could result from a lack of insurance coverage and poor access to care, particularly among the minorities.",1,test,278

We address here two main questions: (1) How do we solve the issue of the subjectivity in the evaluation of data and results, which may be particularly critical for read-across, but may have a role also for the QSAR assessment? (2) How do we take advantage of the results of both approaches to support each other? The QSAR model starts from the training set. The presence of similar chemicals with property values close to that predicted can support the result. The approach in read-across is the opposite. The assessment is focused on the few substances similar to the target. The data quality of the similar chemicals is fundamental. A risk is poor standardization in the definition of 'similarity', because different approaches may be applied. Inspired by the principles of high transparency and reproducibility, a new program for read-across, called ToxRead, has been developed and made freely available ( www.toxgate.eu ). The output of ToxRead can be compared and integrated with the output of QSAR, within a weight-of-evidence strategy.

55601863,"This paper looks at identifying factors affecting forecasting decision making in the supply chain of a government owned corporation (GOC), and how a recent Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) implementation was perceived with respect to the usability of the forecasting modules available. It is argued that GOCs represent a distinct form of organisation and that ERP implementation strategies may need to modify some of their basic assumptions in order to be successful. The research approach used was a case study as this was seen as the most appropriate to uncovering the deeper issues which may be unique to GOCs. The study consisted of two major steps. The first step identified 31 key personal in the supply chain and these people were interviewed to determine the level of need for decision support tools prior to the implementation of a new ERP. The second step of the research involved conducting interviews with16 of the original 31 staff and this was done after the ERP had been implemented for over a year. The feasibility of improving forecasting through the use of decision support system (DSS) and the degree to which the technology can assist forecasting in the supply chain was then explored. It was discovered that data accuracy was a problem. This was not associated with the ERP implementation, but rather with social factors such as different preferences among groups of staff on how to configure procurement and payment of invoices resulting in a lack of a consistent approach across the entire GOC. A lack of trust in the ERP and ineffective training methods were also identified. This research suggests that ERP implementations within GOC's, in particular those with an extensive distributed network such as transport and electricity, are special cases and should be treated differently to implementations in other industries. Further research studies are needed to determine if ERP implementation in GOCs represent a distinct population with special requirements.",1,test,317
36656707,"Abstract This paper investigates theoretically how the structure of means-tested public long-term care (LTC) support influences the relationship between LTC insurance and informal care. Three types of public support encountered in various means-tested LTC schemes are examined. First, the level to be considered for means-testing only takes into account the level of wealth of the recipient without considering the cost of LTC or the possible insurance benefits. Second, the public support also considers the LTC needs of the recipient. Third, the means-test structure takes into consideration insurance benefits as well. Our results show that the optimal levels of insurance and informal care as well as their relationship are strongly influenced by the ways means-tested public support for LTC is structured, which have important implications in terms of public policy for the financing of LTC needs.",1,test,135
53579830,"During the 1960s, different critical voices emerged with regard to the main gaps of technocratic planning (what Jacobs calls ‘modern, orthodox city planning’), voices highlighting the oversimplifying epistemological approaches that had been characterising planning in the first half of the twentieth century. Jane Jacobs’ thought has been of paramount importance in influencing planning and urban discourses worldwide, but she has not been isolated: in the same years, other critical voices have been shaping a critical thought and fostering debate, on both sides of the Atlantic. Among them, Paul Davidoff, appealing for advocacy planning in NYC, Giancarlo De Carlo, proposing a sharp critique of architectural and planning education in Italy and Reyner Banham and his group, advocating the (paradoxical) possibility of non-planning in the UK. This article proposes to identify a relevant common feature across their positions in the connection between epistemological and political critique; as Jane Jacobs, many critics of traditional technocratic planning underline the inappropriate and ineffective mechanisms of knowledge production and use in urban planning: if cities are characterised by organised complexity (‘intricate social and economic order under the seeming disorder of cities’, as Jacobs puts it), then it is not possible to reduce them to ‘simple problems’.

Therefore, we hypothesized that TLR expression and activity may be deregulated in patients with HSK, which would reflect in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses observed in these patients. We investigated the effects of the TLR ligands 3, 4, 7 and 9 (as they are involved in anti-viral immune defence [3]) on cytokine induction from a patient with active HSK and compared responses of this patient to TLR ligands on a subsequent follow up visit where disease was diagnosed to be inactive.",0,test,159
55586072,"Demand response to time-varying pricing of electricity is critical to a smart grid's efficient management of electrical resources. This paper presents a new approach to quantify residential demand responsiveness to (time-of-use) TOU rates, which does not entail an econometric estimation of TOU demand equations. Based on one of the four smart grid pilots in China, our approach uses the survey data collected in 2011 from 236 residents in Yinchuan to implement a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the minimum, expected and maximum demand responsiveness to four TOU rate designs. We find that residents do not respond to TOU pricing when the TOU rate design only causes a 10% increase in their existing electricity bills under non-TOU rates. However, their estimated peak demand responsiveness is 8.41% (21.26%) when the peak-time price increases by 20% (40%). Based on these findings, we conclude that suitably designed TOU rates are useful to the efficient operation of a smart grid.",0,test,155
169989478,"JIPITEC 9 (2018) 2 - After two years of negotiations and several drafts, the provisions of the Directive 2014/26/EU on collective management of copyright and related rights were introduced into Greek legislation by the Law 4481/2017, which establishes a strict legal framework for the collective management organisations and places great emphasis on state control mechanisms. Additionally, Law 4481/2017 introduces a notice-and-takedown procedure as a sanction to the intermediaries (access providers or hosting service providers) and website owners for online violation of intellectual property and related rights. Although it is an attempt to swiftly resolve cases of violation through the internet, the unclear relation of this sanction system to the system laid down by the Law 2121/1993 on copyright and related rights creates several inconsistencies and legal issues.

147148982,"Exposure to traumatic events represents a significant and all-too-common experience for many children and youth. A significant number of youth will receive a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating condition that without treatment will contribute to contemporaneous and long-term negative health consequences. Psychotherapy often has been advocated as the first line in PTSD treatments, and existing interventions have been primarily based on treating individual symptoms. Nevertheless, the deleterious effects of PTSD reverberate beyond the youth; parents, caregivers, and other social influences (e.g., romantic partners) report high levels of distress due the youth’s struggles with their symptoms or due to their own feelings of guilt, shame, or helplessness. Recognizing that social agents are a significant factor in both PTSD recovery, reduction in problematic behaviors, and caregiver stress, there is a surge of PTSD treatments that have been modified to include, either directly or indirectly, social agents. Although still in the beginning stages of development, these treatments hold much promise in treating PTSD and secondary symptoms of the child and reducing distress in others.",0,test,174

55252549,"In civil disputes, the plaintiff must prove his case by the preponderance of the evidence. To reach this standard, the plaintiff accumulates evidence by combining facts. I compare two models of this process. Decision makers can adapt their behavior for improved results, as assumed in some psychological models. Adaptive models predict that court practice will allow the plaintiff to combine facts according to relatively simple rules. Alternatively, decision makers can optimize their behavior for best results, as assumed in most economic models. Optimization models predict that court practice will require the plaintiff to combine facts in ways that conform to the laws of probability theory. The two predictions contradict each other when simple, adaptive rules violate the laws of probability theory. I show that actual practice in a California court allows the plaintiff to combine facts according to relatively simple rules that sometimes violate the laws of probability theory. Adaptation is, consequently, a better descriptive theory than optimization. Procedures that violate the laws of probability theory, however, are vulnerable to withering criticism. Given that trials proceed with deliberate speed under expert guidance, suboptimal adaptations are irrational. Optimization, consequently, is a better normative theory than adaptation.",1,test,195

It charts how they moved from planning a ‘peace by dictation’ of the great powers, to planning one which would be based on a model of collective security involving all members of the United Nations alliance. The latter plan would reflect both the great powers’ special responsibilities for maintaining international peace and security and the stake which lesser powers had in such a venture. In addressing these historical developments the article employs two concepts familiar to International Relations scholarship, namely concert and hierarchy. It shows how the understandings which the principal post-war planners had of these concepts – and crucially of their inter-relationship - changed over time and the consequences of these changes. The article makes two core claims: firstly, that as post-war planning progressed, the attitudes of the Big Three towards the acce...",0,test,157

Accordingly, the goal of this study was to measure head motion of a visually unaware ball carrier during a real game tackle to the upper trunk with no direct head contact, and compare the kinematics with previously reported concussive events. Model-Based Image-Matching was utilised to measure ball carrier head linear and angular velocities. Ball carrier componential maximum change in head angular velocities of 38.1, 20.6 and 13.5 rad/s were measured for the head local X (coronal plane), Y (sagittal plane) and Z (transverse plane) axes respectively.

Unoccupied room noise levels and reverberation times were measured in eight classrooms at four Hong Kong schools for children with special needs. Speech levels in each classroom were measured under three conditions: without amplification, with public address system amplification, and with sound‐field amplification. Speech‐to‐noise ratios were calculated for each condition. Noise and unamplified speech‐to‐noise ratio values exceeded recommended acoustic standards in all classrooms. When sound‐field and public address amplification systems were installed, speech‐to‐noise ratios improved considerably. When either amplification system was used, a uniform sound‐field resulted.

Yet, these two accounts have never been systematically tested against each other, nor have their predictive powers been examined across different measures of the public’s risk perception. In two studies, we gauged risk perception in student samples by employing three measures (frequency, value of a statistical life, and perceived risk) and by using a homogeneous (cancer) and a classic set of heterogeneous causes of death. Based on these judgments of risk, we tested precise models of the availability heuristic and the affect heuristic and different definitions of availability and affect. Overall, availability-by-recall, a heuristic that exploits people’s direct experience of occurrences of risks in their social network, conformed to people’s responses best. We also found direct experience to carry a high degree of ecological validity (and one that clearly surpasses that of affective information). However, the relative impact of affective information (as compared to availability) proved more pronounced in value-of-a-statistical-life and perceived-risk judgments than in riskfrequency judgments. Encounters with risks in the media, in contrast, played a negligible role in people’s judgments. Going beyond the assumption of exclusive reliance on either availability or affect, we also found evidence for mechanisms that combine both, either sequentially or in a composite fashion. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications of our results, including how to foster people’s risk calibration and the success of education campaigns.",0,test,250

The firm will also tend to have lower pay disparity between the CEO and the TMT. The humble CEO and TMT, in turn, will be more likely to adopt an ambidextrous strategic orientation, which will be associated with stronger firm performance. We tested the model by using both survey and archival data that were collected at multiple time points from 105 small-to-medium-sized firms in the computer software and hardware industry in the United States.

892290,"The standard argument for abstracting from capital accumulation in sticky-price macro models is based on their short-run focus: over this horizon, capital does not move much. This argument is more problematic in the context of real exchange rate (RER) dynamics, which are very persistent. In this paper we study RER dynamics in sticky-price models with capital accumulation. We analyze both a model with an economy-wide rental market for homogeneous capital, and an economy in which capital is sector specific. We find that, in response to monetary shocks, capital increases the persistence and reduces the volatility of RERs. Nevertheless, versions of the multisector sticky-price model of Carvalho and Nechio (2011) augmented with capital accumulation can match the persistence and volatility of RERs seen in the data, irrespective of the type of capital. When comparing the implications of capital specificity, we find that, perhaps surprisingly, switching from economy-wide capital markets to sector-specific capital tends to decrease the persistence of RERs in response to monetary shocks. Finally, we study how RER dynamics are affected by monetary policy and find that the source of interest rate persistence -- policy inertia or persistent policy shocks -- is key.",1,test,193

According to the theory, individuals differ in the extent to which they control their self-presentation in social interactions. Some people can observe and control their self-presentation and expressive behaviors. Besides, they are sensitive to cues indicating what expression or behavior is appropriate in any case. This sensitivity has been called „Self-Monitoring‟ skill (Snyder, 1974). In this study the effect of setting „Self-Monitoring‟ strategies during and after the Social Studies course on self-monitoring, self-regulation and academic achievement levels of the students has been investigated. In the present study, a mixed methods approach was taken, and an experimental design with pre-test and post-test and control group was used in the study. The study was carried out with three groups (two experimental groups and one control group). In the qualitative dimension of the study, the opinions of 10 classroom teachers and 20 students were gathered using Fixed Format Questionnaire. Quantitative data were analyzed using the SPSS 15 program and qualitative data were analyzed through descriptive analysis. As a result of the study, it has been observed that self-monitoring strategies used in Social Studies course had an effect on the students‟ self-monitoring and development of academic performance levels, but they had no effect on their self-regulation skills.

33846332,"Theory suggests that management may be able to increase firm value through the strategic use of debt when facing contingent liabilities. This paper examines whether managers strategically use financial policy when facing the risk of one such liability – litigation claims. I find that greater litigation exposure leads firms to choose higher leverage. I show that this leverage increase is brought on by an active decision to repurchase shares. These repurchases appear to be financed with a combination of excess cash and short term debt as they coincide with a significant decrease in cash holdings and an increase in short term liabilities. These firms also increase their use of operating leases, which, due to their priority in bankruptcy, have similar characteristics to secured debt. Finally, the effects seem to be stronger for firms with a higher probability of bankruptcy. These results run counter to anecdotal suggestions that firms may adjust financial policy to build a war chest in anticipation of litigation and they suggest that firms use capital structure strategically to increase shareholder value.",0,test,174

Variation in fliC was characterised and sero-specific motifs identified. Furthermore, it was possible to identify differences in certain H antigens that are not detected by traditional serotyping. A rapid short sequencing assay was developed to target serotype-specific sequence motifs in fliC. The assay was evaluated for identification of H1 antigens with a panel of 55 strains.ConclusionFliC sequences were obtained for more than 100 strains comprising 29 different H1 alleles. Unique pyrosequencing profiles corresponding to the H1 component of the serotype were generated reproducibly for the 23 alleles represented in the evaluation panel. Short read sequence assays can now be used to identify fliC alleles in approximately 97% of the 50 medically most important Salmonella in England and Wales. Capability for high throughput testing and automation give these assays considerable advantages over traditional methods.",0,test,219
35112923,"Abstract Infantile amnesia is a major issue in memory development. For a growing body of researchers, self is probably a key-concept for this enigma. The role of the cognitive self in early declarative memory as a function of perceptual manipulation between study- and test-phase was investigated. Two recall conditions were compared: either the same color props as in the modeling phase or different color props. Twenty-four 20-month-old children were observed in a 10-min deferred imitation task with two enabling sequences. An additional control group (N = 16) ensured that imitation scores did not rely on spontaneous production of the target behaviors at this age. Children in the experimental groups were classified as early or late recognizer depending on their success or failure to the mirror test. A significant interaction was observed between color props conditions and recognizer types: only late recognizers’ memory performance was affected by the perceptual manipulation. Results suggest that cognitive self could be one of the factors contributing to the differentiation between episodic and semantic subsystems in early declarative memory by the end of the second year.",1,test,180

We tested the effect of soil temperature manipulation and nitrogen fertilization on EM communities in a high-altitude Pinus cembra afforestation. The trees had been inoculated in the 1960s in a nursery with a mixture of Suillus placidus, S. plorans and S. sibircus. Sampling was performed during the third year of temperature manipulation in June and October 2013. Root tips were counted, sorted into morphotypes, and sequenced. Fungal biomass was measured as ergosterol and hyphal length. The EM potential of the soil was assessed with internal transcribed spacers (ITS) clone libraries from in-growth mesh bags (MB). Temperature manipulation of ± 1 °C had no effect on the EM community. A total of 33 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, 20 from the roots, 13 from MB. The inoculated Suillus spp. colonized 82% of the root tips, thus demonstrating that the inoculation was sustainable. Nitrogen fertilization had no impact on the EM community, but promoted depletion in soil organic matter, and caused a reduction in soil fungal biomass.",1,test,194
157511094,"The time is ripe for a reappraisal of the separation of powers. The two-dimensional landscape famously described in Justice Robert H. Jackson’s concurring opinion in Youngstown has dominated discourse about the interaction of the three federal branches. Charting presidential conduct on the vertical axis of a map whose horizontal axis measures Congress’s position ranging from approval to disapproval gave Justice Jackson an elegantly simple and memorable way to classify presidential actions from the most strongly defensible to the most constitutionally vulnerable.The resulting classification scheme became a convenient triptych describing the geography of a “flatland” constitutional universe — one constructed in a two-dimensional space, carved into three simple zones. Missing from that triptych has been an analytical guide for navigating a multidimensional universe of relevant constitutional values and relationships.

55578592,"Recent decades have witnessed a remarkable rise in academic research and political discussion on borders and border regions. In broad terms, we can distinguish at least two major traditions which have developed more or less in parallel directions and in increasing interaction with one another. There is the older American tradition of “borderlands studies” that has gained new ground and forms today an established academic institution around the scholarly organization Association of Borderlands Studies (ABS) with its regular conferences and publications, most notably the Journal of Borderlands Studies (JBS). In this review I will concentrate on the more novel European based research tradition which has partly gained inspiration from the American scholarly discussion and partly opened new research directions, with certain influence on the broader international research community. This tradition is perhaps best known through the series of Border Regions in Transition (BRIT) conferences and the publications linked to them. Since the first gathering in Berlin in 1994, there have been ten BRIT conferences organized in Finland, the U.S., India, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Poland, Canada and Chile. Its activities have gathered together scholars from around the world, from Europe and the Americas as well as from Asian countries. In my analysis on the recent trends in border studies I will concentrate mainly in reflecting on the publications of BRIT conferences. As in the U.S., also the European conference and publication activities have led to more challenging institutional forms. Members of the BRIT network have carried out several national and international research projects including large-scale projects of the European Union Framework program for research such as Lines of Exclusion as Arenas of Co-operation (EXLINEA) and Local Dimensions of a Wider European Neighbourhood (EUDIMENSIONS). In addition, new research units and Centres have been established both in the European Union and outside, e.g. Finland, the Netherlands, the UK, Canada, India, Israel and recently even Japan.

Data from 185 restaurants were collected via Internet, phone interviews, site inspections, and ZAGAT Survey, and analyzed using OLS regression. The log-linear model was found to be most suitable for the data, and the proposed hedonic model accounted for as much as 73.7% of the variation in meal prices. The results indicate that food quality and decor were important determinants of restaurants’ average meal prices while service was not. Furthermore, the study found that a restaurant's location within the building (1st floor), the types of cuisine served (Japanese and Italian), parking facilities, private dining settings, franchising, and the number of blogger reviews (e-WOM) have significant effects on restaurants’ average meal prices. The model will provide useful information for restaurateurs in deciding effective menu pricing strategies.",1,test,147

Thus, before we continue to implement instructional technology (IT), we must consider the consequences of those values for instructors as well as students. Moreover, one of the motivations behind using IT is that such techniques transcend the barriers of more traditional Socratic techniques. We argue that once we examine the most compelling arguments for IT (i.e., that it encourages discovery-based, constructive learning styles), it emerges as more Socratic than it would first appear. We maintain that IT has the potential to benefit pedagogy, but caution instructors to think critically about IT, and its implicit ideology, as well as their role of educator rather than trainer.",0,test,124

To test this hypothesis, a survey was conducted to determine public acceptance of the use of various forms of personal information to achieve specific governmental objectives. The data revealed that the public is, in fact, willing to accept the use of personal information to achieve certain governmental objectives; however, not without limitation. Factors that affected the level of acceptance were the achievability of the policy, sensitivity of data being used, the specific governmental objective, and trust in the branch of government utilizing the data.

Research environment is considered to be all public places and the research population comprised of all teenagers and youth of Bushehr. 12 participants were selected by purposive sampling. The method of data collection was semi-structured interviews with Participants that were recorded concession and immediately rewritten and analyzed. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data. Data analysis resulted in three main themes including: “the influence of culture”, “prone context”, and “difficulty of quitting”. The most common reasons of increasing use of hookah in Bushehr are: “common culture of using hookah among family and friends”, “lack of enforcement of prohibiting laws about the use of hookah in public”, “lack of knowledge about hookah complications and having the wrong belief about hookah: (being less harmful than smoking)”, “desirable taste and smell of fruity hookahs” and “having no better fun” and “social stress between young people”.

2317809,"The retinotectal projection in Xenopus laevis has been shown to exhibit correlation-based refinement of both anatomical and functional connectivity during development. Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is an appealing experimental model for correlation-based synaptic plasticity because, in contrast to plasticity induction paradigms using tetanic stimulation or sustained postsynaptic depolarization, its induction protocol more closely resembles natural physiological activity. In Xenopus tadpoles, where anatomical remodeling has been reported throughout much of the life of the animal, in vivo retinotectal STDP has only been examined under a limited set of experimental conditions. Using perforated patch recordings of retina-evoked EPSCs in tectal neurons, we confirmed that repeatedly driving a retinotectal EPSP 5-10 ms prior to inducing an action potential in the postsynaptic cell, reliably produced timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP) of the retinotectal synapse in young wild type tadpoles (stages 41-44). At these stages, retinotectal timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) also could be induced by evoking an EPSP to arrive 5-10 ms after an action potential in the tectal cell. However, retinotectal STDP using this standard protocol was limited to a developmental sensitive period, as we were unable to induce t-LTP or t-LTD after stage 44. Surprisingly, this STDP protocol also failed to induce reliable STDP in albino tadpoles at the early ages when it was effective in wild type pigmented animals. Nonetheless, low-frequency flashes to the eye produced a robust NMDA receptor-dependent retinotectal LTD in stage 47 albino tadpoles, demonstrating that the retinotectal synapse can nonetheless be modified in these animals using different plasticity paradigms.",1,test,250

155225818,"Experts from both sides of the political spectrum in the United States agree that the healthcare system is in trouble. Overall, the U.S. healthcare system costs more and achieves less, per capita, than systems in other OECD nations. Opinions vary strongly, however, on the best solution to the problem. Some argue that public provision would be best able to provide universal coverage with lower prices. Others argue that only the market could ensure efficiency. The healthcare debate in the U.S. is further complicated by lobbying activity to protect existing interests. Health insurance companies argue strongly against any form of public provision, claiming such arrangements would make them unable to compete. Doctors’ organizations, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals also maneuver to ensure that any new legislation would not hurt them. Rather than build a full-scale merit comparison between the American and other industrialized countries’ approaches to healthcare, we simply argue that the U.S. adherence to private insurance does not address the goal of efficiency either with regard to the objective of the simply understood ""economic"" cost-benefit calculation, or in terms of maintaining some normatively set level of accessible care at the lowest cost. The U.S. at present defines its goals insofar as healthcare is concerned not normatively, but via the on-going political process. Currently, the central focus in this process is on cost controls rather than the extent to which politically set standards for care are met. Attempts to create legislation in the U.S. that balances political demands with efficiency are daunting and in practice generally result in sacrificing some of the goals to satisfy pressure groups. Here we approach the issue of efficiency alone, explicitly ignoring political constraints.",0,test,277
154287658,"Instances of acute and sustained inflation pose a challenge in transition and developing economies, in particular as they tend to render economic development strategies vulnerable. Thus, a thorough understanding of inflationary episodes is critical. Using parametric hazard models, this examines the question of duration dependence of international inflationary episodes (IE) and also the influence of key covariates on the likelihood of their survival. From a sample of eleven historical high inflation episodes, fifteen recent hyperinflation cases, and forty-five international IE, the statistical evidence overall illustrates a case of positive duration dependence, indicating that IE are more likely to terminate as they grow older, and vice versa. The study's findings also suggest that variations in covariates including cumulative inflation geometric (annual) rate of inflation, and maximum (annual) inflation tend to have varying and statistically significant influence on the behavior of international IE durations. While not supporting the theoretical notion of an everincreasing inflation rate or inflation bubble, the finding of positive duration dependence in IE is not a justification for a ""laissez-faire"" policy by central banks. In fact, significant redistribution of wealth and increased inefficiency will result from IE, and thus credible monetary and fiscal reforms are fundamental for achieving economic stabilization and sustainable growth.",1,test,204

However, few studies have assessed whether resource subsidies can promote resource decomposition via a population increase in consumers. Here, we examined the effects of keratin subsidies on feather decomposition in egret and heron breeding colonies. Egrets and herons (Ardeidae) frequently breed in inland forests and provide large amounts of keratin materials to the forest floor in the form of feathers of chicks (that die). We compared the decrease in the weights of egret and heron feathers (experimentally placed on the forest floor) over a 12-month period among egret/heron breeding colonies (five sites) and areas outside of colonies (five sites) in central Japan. Of the feathers placed experimentally on forest floors, 92-97 % and 99-100 % in colonies and 47-50 % and 71-90 % in non-colony areas were decomposed after 4 and 12 months, respectively. Then, decomposition rates of feathers were faster in colonies than in areas outside of colonies, suggesting that keratin subsidies can promote feather decomposition in colonies. Field observations and laboratory experiments indicated that keratin-feeding arthropods and keratinophilic fungi played important roles in feather decomposition. Therefore, scavenging arthropods and keratinophilic fungi, which dramatically increased in egret and heron breeding colonies, could accelerate the decomposition of feathers supplied to the forest floor of colonies.",1,test,230

86866524,"Sweden and Norway are two relatively similar countries in many respects. At a superficial glance, this is true also for the regional policy area. At a closer look, however, there are significant differences and consequently different experiences. An important part of the analysis focuses on how regional policies in Sweden as a member of the EU, and Norway as a non-member, are influenced by European integration. Our main hypothesis is that both countries' regional policy aims and measures move towards the EU's, Sweden's faster than Norway's. The current situation seems to be that Sweden increasingly put its trust into the Structural Fund programmes, while national regional policy is allowed to gradually wither away. To Norway as a non-member of the EU this is not an option, regional policy will have to be carried out within the state framework. While the EU dimension is important for understanding differences in recent tendencies, it should not be taken for granted as the decisive factor in explaining differences. This paper tries to illuminate the regional policy experience, to what extent regional policy has a good or bad image in the two countries, as an alternative explanation to the EU dimension.

Results showed that the subliminal mere exposure effect occurred for not only implicit attitudes but also explicit attitudes when participants’ cognitive resources were depleted in the high cognitive load condition.

Experience in developed countries has shown that they reduce the incidence of invasive and non-invasive disease. However, there is evidence that the introduction of PCVs in universal mass vaccination programs, combined with inappropriate and extensive use of antibiotics, could be associated to changes in non-PCV serotypes, including serotype 19A. We conducted a systematic review to determine the distribution of serotype 19A, burden of pneumococcal disease and antibiotic resistance in the region. We performed a systematic review of serotype 19A data from observational and randomized clinical studies in the region, conducted between 1990 and 2010, for children under 6 years. Pooled prevalence estimates from surveillance activities with confidence intervals were calculated. We included 100 studies in 22 countries and extracted data from 63. These data reported 19733 serotyped invasive pneumococcal isolates, 3.8% of which were serotype 19A. Serotype 19A isolates were responsible for 2.4% acute otitis media episodes, and accounted for 4.1% and 4.4% of 4,380 nasopharyngeal isolates from healthy children and in hospital-based/sick children, respectively. This serotype was stable over the twenty years of surveillance in the region. A total of 53.7% Spn19A isolates from meningitis cases and only 14% from non meningitis were resistant to penicillin.

167448192,"Risk management is critical for a credit card company to survive in such competing industry. In addition to operational expenses, provisional loss is a major driver to a company’s expense. The provisional loss arises due to the “bad” accounts booked – bank lends the money to customers who eventually do not have capability to pay back. In the risk management, there are generally two stages a company can take to manage and control credit risks. The first stage occurs when booking a customer. An aggressive underwriting strategy could book and approve high risk population who seeks for credit card; while a conservative policy may only focus on upmarket and affluent population. As expected, the first strategy could generate both high revenues (interests charged) and high expenses due to bad accounts booked, resulting in trivial incremental net income; and the second strategy could generate not only low revenues but also low losses, resulting in incremental net income be trivial as well. There is always trade-off for different strategies in terms revenue generation and loss control. Finding an optimal strategy is often difficult and needs to be adjusted accordingly due to internal or external factors such as macroeconomic change, for example, almost all credit companies suppressed their approval rates for high risk segments of population and incurred huge financial loss during 2008/2009 economic depression. The second stage happens in customer management after the customer is booked. Although booked customers pass the first screen of risk control, the chance of false negative (false “good” accounts) could still be high. However, in the second stage, by leveraging their performance such as credit card utilization, payment information, risks can further be managed to control provisional loss. In our project, we will focus on the second stage of risk management, and particularly are interested in classifying if a booked account will be a “bad” account within 12 months since booked. Since an internal classification model is already available, our second interest is to train a better classifier to outperform the benchmark model.",1,test,336
155038504,"Our intellectual starting point is Humboldt’s vision for higher education which arguably recently finds its strongest current manifestation in the US undergraduate research programmes which are frequently for selected students. We argue the task now is to ‘reinvent’ the curriculum to ensure that all undergraduate students in all higher education institutions learn through some form of research or inquiry. This argument follows from the international research evidence of the student experience of research and inquiry. We illustrate the argument with initiatives by curricula teams, departments and institutions who have attempted to ‘mainstream’ undergraduate research and inquiry for most or all students. ""We want all students to access the benefits exposure to teaching informed by research can bring. ... We believe an understanding of the research process – asking the right questions in the right way; conducting experiments; and collating and evaluating information – must be a key part of any undergraduate curriculum.” (Bill Rammell, UK Minister for Higher Education, 2006, p. 3).",0,test,162

Follow- ing the overview, we review a selection of possible causes and some documented academic opposi- tion against approaches dealing with the boy-problem. We end with a proposal for a problem- focused 10-point plan to reduce the boy-problem. Our plan is “problem-focused” instead of “gender- focused”; that is, we focus on a set of problems from which boys suffer more than girls, but there is no reason why girls suffering from the same problems (e.g. excessive gaming) would not also benefit from the plan's implementation. We are optimistic that a solution of the boy-problem is possible, in particular because the proposed plan is affordable and straightforward, although it requires a major change in societal attitudes towards discipline and education.",0,test,150

154788600,"Major changes have been challenging journalism in the last two decades, in the context of the ‘digital age’. The technological possibilities developed in the ‘information society’, together with the social and cultural trend for more participation, opened this field to new actors, which caused professional journalists to lose their traditional monopoly of searching, gathering, editing and diffusing news in the public sphere. At the same time, these new possibilities of communicating are increasingly forcing the old actors to play new roles in the media. The digital techniques and the Internet gave birth to a big diversity of new media and of new forms of dealing with journalism and public information. ‘Citizen journalism’, ‘participatory journalism’, ‘user-generated content’, ‘crowdsourcing’, ‘weblogs’,‘ Twitter’, ‘Facebook’, etc., are words and expressions rather common these days, all of them somehow calling the attention to the fact that journalism-as-a-professional-activity seems to coexist more and more with various forms of journalismas-a-civic-activity , performed by very different people, under very different conditions and with very different levels of involvement and expertise. As a consequence, questions are being raised about the ethical implications of this new scenario, both in what regards the activity of professional journalists in new (online) media and the active commitment of ‘laypersons’ in the process of gathering, editing and diffusing information. In this paper we will try to analyze and to discuss these questions, with reference, among others, to Eliot Freidson (2004) and his distinction between ‘practice ethics’ and ‘institutional ethics’. Furthermore, we’ll try to discuss what really makes journalism distinctive from other practices that nowadays coexist with it in the public sphere, strongly increasing the possibilities of communication between people but not necessarily following the purposes of public interest and of civic democratic participation. In this context, the concept of journalism seems to ask for a clearer definition, and so do the roles to be played by journalists in the more complex (but also more stimulating) media environment we are dealing with in contemporary societies.",0,test,329

Five 1-day-old neonatal mice were exposed by oral inoculation to the homogenized brain of a scrapie-affected sheep. In the small intestine of all mice 1 hour after inoculation, immunoreactivity with antinormal prion protein (PrPc) antibody was seen in the cytoplasm of villus enterocytes. This finding suggests transmission of abnormal PrPsc into the cytoplasm of enterocytes. In control mice treated with normal sheep brain, no PrPc signal was seen in enterocytes of the small intestine. Immunopositivity for neurofilament protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein was seen in the cytoplasm of enterocytes of mice inoculated with scrapie and normal sheep brain. This suggests that the enterocytes of neonatal mice can absorb PrPsc and other macromolecular proteins of the sheep brain affected by scrapie and may be more important than previously thought as a pathway for PrPsc transmission in neonatal animals.",1,test,172

157545863,"We study equilibrium investment strategies of firms competing in stochastic dynamic market settings and facing two types of investment structures: investment with significant lead time (or time-to-build) and investment without (or minor) lead time. We investigate how investment behavior changes when investment is subject to time-to-build versus when it is not. We characterize equilibrium investment strategies under several information structures and compare results to the social optimum. We offer some new results. The model predicts that, controlling for demand, and production and investment costs, investments and outputs can be higher in progressive industries (which often exhibit time-to-build) than in fast-paced industries (where time-to-build is insignificant). Furthermore, for both investment types (investment with or without time-to-build) we offer a novel equilibrium in which firms incrementally invest. This behavior is driven by demand uncertainty and capacity constraints. Also, expected outputs are lower than Cournot outputs as firms face uncertainty. Moreover, the amount of uncertainty has different effects over investment types.",1,test,158

18718737,"The relationship between the planner and community in a community-based project is a well-documented concern. Often noted is the need for grassroots work to be carried out ‘with,’ rather than ‘on’ or ‘for,’ a community. Although this notion implies partnership, how the planner-community relationship is conceived depends largely on how the community is defined. From a community-based perspective, action is critical to the development of a community’s identity. This outlook suggests that participation determines community membership. Accordingly, conventional community limits may be transformed. The purpose of this article is to offer an understanding of how community-based planners may be viewed to be community members. The focus is the various perspectives on community and their respective implications for membership. To begin, the traditional perspective of community that is grounded in realism is presented. A community-based outlook based on participation is then provided. Subsequently recognized is the importance of dialogue, which is an underdeveloped and, at times, overlooked strategy in community-based practice. The connection between the planner and community is later described, followed by an examination of the issue of power. To conclude, an emphasis is placed on the possibility for a planner to become a community member when a project follows community-based philosophy.",0,test,202
34380384,"Most strategies for selection portfolios focus on utilizing solely market data and implicitly assume that stock markets communicate all relevant information to all market stakeholders, and that these markets cannot be influenced by investor activities. However convenient, this is a limited approach, especially when applied to small and illiquid markets such as the Croatian market, where such assumptions are hardly realistic. Thus, there is a demand for including other sources of data, such as financial reports. Research poses the question of whether financial ratios as criteria for stock selection are of any use to Croatian investors. Financial and market data from selected publicly companies listed on the Croatian capital market are used. A two-stage portfolio selection strategy is applied, where the first stage involves selecting stocks based on the respective Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) efficiency scores. DEA models are becoming popular in stock portfolio selection given that the methodology includes numerous models that provide a great flexibility in selecting inputs and outputs, which in turn are considered as criteria for portfolio selection. Accordingly, there is much room for improvement of the current proposed strategies for selecting portfolios. In the second stage, two portfolio-weighting strategies are applied using equal proportions and scoreweighting. To show whether these strategies create outstanding out–of–sample portfolios in time, time-dependent DEA Window Analysis is applied using a reference time of one year, and portfolio returns are compared with the market portfolio for each period. It is found that the financial data are a significant indicator of the future performance of a stock and a DEA-based portfolio strategy outperforms market return.",1,test,263

43566017,"This article examines the causes of stability and change in vote intentions during the 2014 Belgian federal election campaign. Drawing on data from the 2014 Parti Rep Belgian Voter Survey, our study aims to explain why a large number of voters have switched their vote intention in the weeks preceding the federal elections. To this end, we test a series of hypotheses drawn from different theories often referred to in the literature to account for campaign volatility. The results of our analysis reveal that voters can decide to change their vote preferences during the campaign due to strategic considerations related to their perceptions of the coalition potentials of parties. We also find that voters with a low level of political interest are more likely than highly interested voters to switch from one party to another in the weeks preceding the electoral contest. Unsurprisingly, a high degree of affection for the favourite party proves to be a barrier against campaign volatility. The higher the level of affect directed to the most preferred party, the more stable will be the vote intention. Moreover, results show that citizens with a low level of external political efficacy are more prone than others to switch parties in the last weeks of the campaign. By contrast, the ideological profile of the voter has no significant impact on campaign volatility.",1,test,223

145584266,"Legal reforms over the past generation have transformed juvenile crime regulation from a system that viewed most youth crime as the product of immaturity into one that is ready to hold many youths to the standard of accountability imposed on adults. Supporters of these reforms argue that they are simply a response to the inability of the traditional juvenile court to deal adequately with violent youth crime, but the legal changes that have transformed the system have often been undertaken in an atmosphere of moral panic, with little deliberation about consequences and costs.In this book we argue that a developmental model of regulation that is grounded in scientific knowledge about adolescence and juvenile crime is more compatible with the justice system's commitment to fairness and also more likely to promote social welfare than the contemporary approach. This premise for the most part translates into a legal regime that deals with most adolescent offenders as an intermediate legal category of persons - neither children nor adults. Developmental knowledge clarifies that the typical teenage offender is less culpable than his adult counterpart and therefore deserves less punishment. It also indicates that most adolescents mature out of their inclination to get involved in criminal activity, and that correctional interventions may influence the trajectories of their adult lives. The research shows that programs that attend to developmental knowledge are likely to facilitate the transition to conventional adult roles, benefiting both young offenders and society by reducing recidivism and reducing the economic costs of crime regulation.",0,test,251

141424722,"This paper argues that in the wake of Crawford, Davis, and Bryant, trial courts are in need of a workable definition of “ongoing emergency,” as well as a test or set of guidelines that can be applied in assessing the admissibility of statements made under such circumstances. In essence, this paper seeks to answer two important questions now confronting trial courts: (1) what is an “ongoing emergency,” and (2) what set of factors can enable a trial court to establish the existence of an ongoing emergency? Ultimately, in defining “ongoing emergency,” this paper borrows from earlier Supreme Court rulings in the Fourth Amendment context. For purposes of the Confrontation Clause, this paper defines “ongoing emergency” the same way the Court has previously defined “exigent circumstances”: a situation in which “there is an imminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that evidence will be immediately destroyed” for the purpose of hindering future prosecution, “or that a suspect will escape.” This definition is relied upon in part because it is offered, in dissent, by Justice Ginsburg, a vocal critic of the Court’s apparent retreat from Crawford. It is also relied upon, in part, because it seems to stand up to most situations in which officers might obtain statements from a declarant not solely for the purpose of preserving testimony for future prosecution. This paper also prescribes a flexible totality of the circumstances test that courts can apply in ascertaining whether the facts surrounding a declarant’s statement(s) do, in fact, constitute an emergency. This test places great emphasis on whether the facts create a situation in which the declarant’s statement bears sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant admission.",0,test,277

This paper examines leadership-productivity nexus using Nigeria as a focal point. This paper reviews critically the concepts of leadership and productivity.

Further, it explores the various meanings of productivity, how it is measured, factors that affect it and some benefits associated with productivity improvement. In discussing leadership-productivity nexus, the paper argues that situations usually determine the leadership style that may be applied to motivate higher productivity among employees in work organisations. The paper posits that due to poor style of leadership, productivity of workers in both public and private sectors has remained dismal. However, this is not surprising considering the fact that work organisations are the microcosms of larger Nigeria society in which poor political leadership has deprived the nation from transforming from a poverty stricken country to a more prosperous and buoyant one.

As nations move farther and farther away from the era of authoritarianism, we might naturally assume that the influence of those regimes would dissipate as well. The books under review here arrive on our shelves two decades or more since many of the countries of the region recovered their democratic practices. It would be convenient to say that the mere passage of time has erased painful memories of the repression, rendered militaries less politically influential, and given democratic institutions time to congeal. It would also be wrong. It turns out that memories cannot be easily erased, even less so for the families of victims who have never recovered the bodies of their loved ones or have never had their day in court. Military institutions vary in influence but remain relevant, at times interventionist, and have to be dealt with. Progress toward institutional consolidation can be found, but many democracies are still struggling, and some are in serious trouble. For these reasons alone, these three books are timely and relevant.

61017032,"Not long after computer scientists first began working on the technical design of the network that ultimately became known as the Internet, in 1969, they began to document their discussions, information shared, and decisions made in a series of documents known as the Internet requests for comments that is still being used for this purpose 40 years later. A comprehensive inductive reading of these documents reveals that legal and policy issues were often raised or confronted in the course of resolving technical problems. In many of these instances, the technical decisions that resulted had law-like effects in the sense that they constrained or enabled the ways in which users can communicate and can access and use information over the Internet, whether or not such decisions supported or subverted legal decision-making, and whether or not legal decision-makers understood the societal implications of the technical decisions that were being made. This is one of the two ways in which technical and legal decision-making have become interpenetrated. The literature on legal engagement with problems generated by the technical features of the Internet is vast.

The fact that these reforms came quickly after the closing of early retirement opportunities urged the pre-pension cohorts to adjust their retirement outlooks. This research studied older workers’ emotional reactions to reforms that induce them to extend their working lives with a number of years. Using data from a large scale sample survey among 6,800 older workers in the Netherlands, aged 60–65 at time of interview in 2015, we examined why the pension reforms trigger stronger emotional reactions in some individuals than in others. We integrated theoretical insights from the theory of emotion and the resource-based perspective on retirement adjustment. Testing our hypotheses revealed that emotions are stronger among individuals that have less access to resources. Anger and worry is more prevalent among older workers in more demanding jobs, with less favorable personal (health, wealth) and social resources (no partner support). This research suggests that policy makers—mostly higher level professionals who are much less exposed to the challenges of working longer—have underestimated the psychological and social impact of the reforms on vulnerable groups of older workers and, in particular, less educated older workers with lower social status. With a further increase of retirement age to be expected, policy makers are challenged to design policies that spare vulnerable groups in particular, for example, by facilitating more flexibility in the retirement transition.",1,test,246

However, as amounts of industrial clusters have displayed their competence, some have lost their competitive advantages in global competition. It is meaningful for clusters’ development to cultivate their sustainable competence. This paper analyzes the sources of cluster competence. According this paper, the important ways to make cluster competence sustainable include transferring and sharing knowledge, making innovation in the cluster, absorbing knowledge from other outer sources, and cultivating unique and exclusive knowledge innovation capability that is differing from other clusters. This paper advances two ways for clusters achieving the transformation from closed knowledge system to open one: firstly, cultivate the capability of absorbing new knowledge from other local knowledge sources; secondly, improve the capability of knowledge share and innovation in the cluster.",0,test,132

Section one is about the humanitarian aid burden of the EU and the major European donor countries in the years 1999-2012. The analysis draws attention to the existing coherence at the world level and also to the difference existing in the aid to the countries of the Middle East and North Africa region. Section two analyses and shows the consistency of Italy’s aid with the ECHO’s. In the Conclusions, the coherence of the EU’s and states’ aid and the consistency of Italy’s aid are shortly discussed in view of the existing shared powers in the humanitarian and civil protection policy area.",1,test,139
154686706,"In many developing countries, firms confront a highly adverse business environment. In these cases, development 'should not' occur and observers tend to recommend government policy reform. The World Bank ranks India 116th out of 155 countries according to the ease of 'doing business'. Indian managers spend a great deal of their time dealing with government regulations and bureaucracy. However, despite these difficulties there has been an explosion of technology-based entrepreneurship in India's software and IT industries. In theory, the Indian software industry 'should not' have developed in the way it did. This paper shows how Indian software entrepreneurs overcame institutional barriers to development and how they themselves initiated institutional change, despite Government's restrictive policies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Indian software firms were able to circumvent government imposed restrictions to growth and lead institutional reform in India. If India's entrepreneurs can do it perhaps others can too.",1,test,146
31384825,"Abstract The author examines how time delayed effects of economic development, education, and gender equality influence political democracy. Literature review shows inadequate understanding of lagged effects, which raises methodological and theoretical issues with the current quantitative studies of democracy. Using country-years as a unit of analysis, the author estimates a series of OLS PCSE models for each predictor with a systematic analysis of the distributions of the lagged effects. The second set of multiple OLS PCSE regressions are estimated including all three independent variables. The results show that economic development, education, and gender have three unique trajectories of the time-delayed effects: Economic development has long-term effects, education produces continuous effects regardless of the timing, and gender equality has the most prominent immediate and short term effects. The results call for the reassessment of model specifications and theoretical setups in the quantitative studies of democracy.",0,test,144

This problem is especially interesting in a time where schools are having their budgets vastly cut. The importance of education is lauded as the reason to allow marketing, along with it being used as a teaching tool, among other reasons. The opponents of in-school marketing are discussed, such as health and psychological problems and the social functions of school. I conclude that marketing in U.S. public schools should no longer be allowed, but that it is only realistic to eliminate it gradually.",0,test,97
154225244,"As western societies become increasingly dependent on scientific and technological developments, the full exercise of citizenship requires the ability to understand those developments. Scientists should be able to make this progress meaningful to different communities and to discuss its implications. However, science communication is still not part of the formal education of researchers. We organized a pioneering workshop in Portugal, Comunicar Ciencia (‘Comunicating Science’), at the Gulbenkian Institute of Science (10-12 September 2003). In this workshop, 17 Portuguese scientists, from PhD students to heads of research institutes, experienced a plethora of practical exercises organised by journalists and science communication experts from Portugal and the UK. Summary and follow-up evaluations show that scientists feel more confident in their communication skills and ability to participate in activities after the workshop. This work suggests that when targeting the right people, a small, low budget activity, such as this science communication workshop, can improve the participation of scientists in science communication activities.",1,test,158
153823144,"In view of the continuum of human existence, it is apparent that we are always living in between the past and the future. Yet we intuitively and perpetually make arbitrary demarcations among the past, the present, and the future. Parallel to one’s memory of one’s lived early childhood experience, our collective memory of the past — especially the remote past — can be hazy, indefinite, and surrealistic. Just as one’s present state of mind shapes one’s understanding of one’s early childhood experiences, contemporaneous ideologies can circumscribe historical inquiries into the collective past. Thus, teaching about the past is always a value-laden inquiry. As Ann Chinnery is keenly aware of the interconnections between the aims and the methods of teaching about the past, she argues that teaching about the past must foster critical historical consciousness so learners may apprehend and appreciate difficult knowledge from the past. To Chinnery, cultivating critical historical consciousness differs from “a cognitive, knowledge-based approach” to recollecting the past. More specifically, Chinnery, in line with Emmanuel Levinas and Roger Simon, acknowledges and affirms that one’s “here and now subjectivity” has always been interwoven with the past at both individual and collective levels. Drawing from her teaching experience, Chinnery further concludes that cultivating critical historical consciousness need not rely upon personal testimony. Instead, teaching and learning about the past should focus on facilitating learners’ undertaking critical contextual inquiries into the formation of subjectivity and public policies. Such critical inquiries, while disquieting, can lead to recognizing our ethical responsibilities of “receiving the past” and “shaping the future.”",0,test,257

Conventionally designed electricity markets cope with uncertainty by running two markets: a market that is cleared ahead of time, followed by a real-time balancing market to reconcile actual realizations of demand and available generation. In such mechanisms, the initial clearing process does not take into account the distribution of outcomes in the balancing market.

Indeed, in most European Union (EU) countries, there has been broad consensus about integration between the main parties. Importantly, previous research shows that this elite convergence is not replicated among the voters. Using European Election Study (EES) data from the 1999 and 2004 Euroelections, this article analyses the ideological dispersion of parties on the EU dimension in the EU member states. We examine the development of inter-party competition on the EU dimension between the two elections, and then test the impact of various factors – divided into public opinion, national party system and EU hypotheses – on the breadth of party positions over integration. The strongest link exists between government size and ideological alternatives, with large coalition governments hindering party competition on the EU dimension.

115132320,"A consumption tax amounts to exempt savings from taxation. As such, it would have important distributional effects, first of all from the poor to the rich, but also towards capital intensive industries; and intergenerational, away from the very young (students) and the old. For what concerns long term effects, most studies show that a consumption tax would be moderately more efficient and much simpler than the income tax. Nevertheless with such a tax, the progressivity of the current system could not be replicated. Attempts to mitigate the regressive features of the consumption tax would unavoidably lower the efficiency gains, and significantly increase complexity. I conclude that the passage to a consumption tax has to be done on the basis of a judgement of value (how progressive should our tax system be?), and not based on technical arguments. Shifting to a consumption tax would also imply an extremely complex transition that could be characterised by unemployment and inflation. For monetary policy, monitoring the economy during this transition would be extremely complex. Given the mixed picture that emerges from the analysis, I conclude asking why the consumption tax has taken such an echo in the current debate. May be because it is supposed to serve objectives that are not explicitly stated: either the objective of increasing competitiveness (but then, other tools like the exchange rate seem more straightforward and efficient), or the objective of reducing public spending.",0,test,235

In this article it tries to analyze and assessed some ways of mainstreaming gender taken place in the Gender and Development Program of Surigao del Sur State University. Objective: It sought to analyze the extent to which GAD has been able to mainstream gender in education, and whether there is a difference between the perception of students and teachers towards the implementation of GAD. Researcher made questionnaire was used. Results: It was found out that the GAD Program was implemented yet it was not a priority concern for the institution, not strictly implemented and institutionalized. Moreover, the result shows a difference between the perception of students and teachers towards GAD implementation. The respondents have proposed solutions that would help in the institutionalization of Gender and Development in SDSSU Cantilan Campus. Conclusion: The Commission on Higher Education has spearheaded a call for partnership among Higher Education in strengthening gender equality, development and peace; and reaffirming their commitment in having gender disparity and women empowerment in the higher education sector.

155689443,"Sustainability is probably the ultimate goal of any entrepreneur when initiating or developing a business. As it involves competitiveness, companies aim to produce differentiated economic offerings by reusing and sharing processes, components, information and knowledge ? many times from different domains. However, to be effective, this should be envisaged already when developing the entrepreneurial plan or when assessing the opportunity of extending the business – therefore the need for planning / implementing / integrating several business lines (from various domains). As many of them may look attractive, an effective decision of starting one business line or another should be supported by some tool that allows a systematic assessment of the opportunity of implementing them. This paper proposes an algorithm that supports entrepreneurs in this respect. The opportunity of developing new business lines is assessed by estimating the mutual impact between them and existing business lines, their impact on organizational performance, and additional indicators such as financial effort, the estimated return on investment, technical and organizational difficulty, risk level or domain financing opportunities. An application example is presented in which an SME in an interdisciplinary domain (covering IT and life-sciences) assesses the opportunity of opening two new business lines.",0,test,198

Some intently wait to hear the buzzer; others look toward the stands. A spectator waves her hand at one of the athletes and cheers. A few more seconds pass. Then the buzzer sounds. Most competitors dive in, though the athlete in my lane needs a bit more encouragement. I glance to my right at Amber, the other timer in my lane. Rule one of volunteering at Special Olympics Ohio: Never tell an athlete “go” unless you mean it. Our eyes communicate what we don’t need to say. She and I cry “Go, John!” at the top of our lungs and watch him dive in after his competitors. We laugh as water flies onto our faces and clothing from the splash of his start. John takes off down the lane, inching closer to his competitors on the first lap of his 200-meter freestyle. * * * Modern sport spectators often exist in a liminal space. A story my mother tells about taking me at age three to watch my first local 12-and-under girls’ soccer match captures this feeling. Standing comfortably within my mother’s arms, I was supposedly mesmerized by the game for the first five minutes. When my mother reached for a water bottle, I instantly broke free and ran onto the field, crying, “Dana’s turn! Dana’s turn!” Luckily the girls were able to maneuver the ball around me until the referee called a timeout. Albeit brief, my experience as a spectator positioned me between two opposing desires: passively appreciating the home team and actively joining the fun. According to historian Allen Guttmann, many avid sports fans are in fact athletes themselves, as there is a “strong, positive correlation between active and passive sport participation.”2 Via this model we can begin to understand an organization like Special Olympics. Its motto, “Be a Fan,” speaks to the power, worth, and necessity of spectators in perpetuating the endeavors of the organization.3 The 2008 Swimming Championships of the Special Olympics Ohio Summer Games reminds us of the value of joining in the celebration of the human capacity for excellence, despite possible preconceived notions about competitors with special needs. 4",0,test,378

16557928,"Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) are two of the most important repair enzymes that are involved in the base excision repair processes to eliminate oxidative damage from mammalian DNA, which accumulates with aging. Red and white skeletal muscle fibers have very different antioxidant enzyme activities and resistance to oxidative stress. In this paper, we demonstrate that the activity of OGG1 is significantly higher in the red type of skeletal muscle compared with white fibers from old rats. Exercise training resulted in increased OGG1 activity in the nuclei of red fibers and decreased activity in nuclei of white fibers and in the mitochondria of both red and white fibers. The activities of UDG were similar in both red and white muscle fibers. Exercise training appears to increase the activity of UDG in the nuclei and mitochondria. However, exercise training affects the activity of OGG1 in nuclei and mitochondria differently, suggesting different regulation of the enzymes. In contrast, UDG showed similar activities in nuclei and mitochondrial extracts of exercise-trained animals. These data provide evidence for differential regulation of UDG and OGG1 in maintaining fidelity of DNA in oxidatively stressed cells.",1,test,192

From a technical perspective, we want to be able to ensure the protection of agent state, the viability of agent communities, and the reliability of the resources on which they depend. To accomplish this, we must guarantee insofar as possible that the autonomy of agents can always be bounded by explicit enforceable policy that can be continually adjusted to maximize their effectiveness and safety in both human and computational environments. From a social perspective, we want agents to be designed so as to fit well with how people actually work together. Explicit policies governing human-agent interaction based on careful observation of work practice and an understanding of current social science research can help assure that effective and natural coordination, appropriate levels and modalities of feedback, and adequate predictability and responsiveness to human control are maintained. We see these technical and social factors as key to providing the reassurance and trust that are prerequisite to the widespread acceptance of agent technology for nontrivial applications.",1,test,184
25568243,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW ::: Impaired sodium excretion in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can drive fluid overload and hypertension and accelerate CKD progression. Diuretics reduce fluid overload but require residual kidney function to work. Adherence to dietary sodium restriction is generally poor. Here, we review an alternative pharmacologic strategy aimed at reducing sodium absorption from the gut. ::: ::: ::: RECENT FINDINGS ::: Genetic studies implicate the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) as the major absorptive sodium transporter. Pharmacologic inhibition of apically expressed gut NHE3 offers the potential of reducing sodium absorption and fluid overload independent of kidney function and with better safety than systemic drugs. Two small-molecule inhibitors of NHE3 (tenapanor and SAR218034) with minimal systemic exposure reduce urinary sodium and increase stool sodium in a dose-dependent manner in rodents, with similar results observed with tenapanor in humans. These molecules also reduce blood pressure in rat models of CKD (tenapanor) and hypertension (SAR218034). Clinical trials of tenapanor in patients with CKD-related disorders are ongoing. ::: ::: ::: SUMMARY ::: Pharmacologic inhibition of gut NHE3 may be a viable strategy for managing sodium load in patients with CKD or with sodium-sensitive hypertension in general. Ongoing clinical trials will shed further light on the potential benefits of this approach.",1,test,209

Data were collected through the use of semi structured interview schedule, key informant interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) and analyzed using percentages, mean scores and trend analysis. Only 1.8% of the farmers from Nigeria, 2.5% from Sierra Leone and 0.7% from Liberia possessed special training on climate change adaptation and food security issues. The presence of local collaboration among actors was higher in Nigeria than in Sierra Leone and Liberia. There was nonexistence of overseas linkages with majority (89.0% for Nigeria; 98.0 for Sierra Leone and 96.8% for Liberia) of the farmers across the three countries. The intensity of linkages / collaborations existing among actors in the enterprise domain, in the three countries, outweighs that with other domains, with higher collaborations existing among the small-scale farmers and famers’ associations. However, there was a perceived increase in the trend of linkage between farmers and R & D institutions in Nigeria between 2007 and 2009, with a linkage index of more than 2. There was also an increasing higher linkage index (of more than 2) between farmers and technology delivery institutions in Nigeria than in Sierra Leone and Liberia, but a low linkage index of less than 2 between farmers and policy making bodies for all the countries. Poor generation of innovations over the past ten years and poor domestic support for climate change adaptation and food security in the West African sub-region were identified. The study points to the need to intensify the collaboration efforts, between local and foreign partners, as this will bring about the generation of better and improved innovations on food security and adaptive measures.",1,test,301
26500768,"Although the waveform derived from a peripheral pulse monitor or pulse oximeter may resemble an arterialpressure waveform, it is in fact a visualization of blood volume change in transilluminated tissue caused by passage of blood: an indication of perfusion or bloodflow. Most currently available pulse oximeters indicate this flow, but few display it in usable form. Since adequate tissue blood flow is a prerequisite for normal metabolic activity, it is a parameter that should merit a place in standard anesthesia or intensive care monitors. That the peripheral tissue blood flow is not routinely displayed may be in part due to the difficulty in quantifying data obtained: flow is not accurately measured as simply as pressure, even by invasive means. It is in the pattern of the waveform that beat-to-beat changes in stroke volume can be better seen than measured, or in the interaction of ventilation and circulation that tests general circulatory performance. The origin and interpretation of these changes are discussed and illustrated with examples. We indicate how new physiological tests of autonomic function and cardiac preload can be developed using pulse plethysmography. The importance and application of the Valsalva effect on the waveform is emphasized. This effect is particularly applicable for monitoring adequate fluid loading and the action of vasodilator drugs, which are both important in anesthesia.

156693728,"Notions surrounding ‘creativity’ have become key elements of Dublin’s policy formation over the last decade. Predominantly, this policy focus has been influenced by Richard Florida’s ‘creative-class’ thesis. For Florida (2002), the future of urban economies revolves around the attraction and retention of the ‘creative class’. Loosely speaking, the ‘creative class’ comprises workers in fields such as the arts, academia, the sciences as well as the legal profession and business management. Florida suggests that in order to remain competitive, cities must promote the type of environment to which the ‘creative class’ is attracted because companies (and highly mobile investment capital) are attracted to where these individuals are located. This environment comprises city centre locations with high-quality amenities, such as bars, restaurants and good quality public space. Given the attraction of the city image projected by the ‘creative-class’ thesis, it has proved popular with city authorities on a global scale, and particularly in North America and Europe (Peck, 2005; Houston et al, 2008; Zimmerman, 2008). While the ‘creative-class’ concept emerged during a period of relative economic prosperity, it has proved a particularly resilient form of policy in the context of the global financial crisis.

149054286,"During the last decades, the world has been going through major technological, economic and social changes. The evolutionary process has brought people together through flows of communication into global digital networks to an extent that scientists have started to talk of the rise of a new geological era called “Anthropocene”. The paper “Programming the State—Digital Technology and Institutional Design” focuses on political aspects of the on-going technological transformation bringing us into a digital society. The aim is to discuss the relation between political and technological change by applying historical institutional theory to explain and understand how ideas and ideology are embedded into digital political institutions. The discussion starts by explaining the basic concepts used in historical institutional theory such as path dependency and formative moments. I then turn to a theory of history formulated by R.G. Collingwood, as this help to understand how the formation of political institutions may be studied in terms of a design process. My argument is that in order to understand the design of political institutions we have to include the study of political ideology since ideologies serve as the design plan for specific institutional solutions. If we are to understand the logic of digitalization we have to be aware of which ideas that are embedded into digital technological solutions. The presentation ends with a discussion on the implications that may be drawn by this argument and whether or not it is possible to turn back from a path once chosen to step upon.",1,test,248
49210553,"This paper addresses the generation of rents and the distribution of gains in the global operations of governed Global Value Chains (GVCs) and seeks to provide an architecture for analyzing the governance of GVCs. It distinguishes between four sets of rent—gifts of nature; innovation rents; exogenously defined rents; and market power—and three spheres of governance—setting the rules -“legislative governance”; implementing the rules -“executive governance”; and monitoring rules and sanctioning malfeasance -“judicial governance.” The exercise of governance power in GVCs over the generation, protection and appropriation of rents is considered though the lens of four sets of key GVC stakeholders—the corporate sector, civil society organizations, the nation state and supranational institutions. This general analysis is given flesh through three case studies: food-safety standards in GVCs; taxation policies and competition policies. In these sectors, the corporate sector is generally much more effective in governing rent generation and appropriation in the global operations of GVCs than are the three sets of non-corporate stakeholders. From this observation we offer a hypothesis that the capacity of non-corporate stakeholders, including national states, to govern GVCs is contingent upon the extent to which this coincides with the interest of the corporate sector. However, as noted, this balance of power between private and non-corporate actors is a contested terrain and dynamic in nature.",0,test,215

59490879,"The study of institutional change over a period of history involves several theoretical and methodological issues. In proposing a commentary on our article published in Vol. 17 n°3 of M@n@gement (Peton and Peze, 2014), Daudigeos, Boutinot and Jaumier have provided an opportunity to open up the debate, and we thank them for that. Their commentary concerns two major points: a methodological question concerning the choice of data in a historical research context, and a resulting reflection on the consideration given to collective representations in analysis of institutional work. Before replying in concrete terms to the points raised by Daudigeos et al., we wish to return to the objective of our article and clear up one matter they raise. Our study starts with reflection on the different institutional pillars. While Scott (2008) stresses the importance of all three pillars (normative, cognitive and regulative), the regulative pillar is rarely studied in the literature on change. It finds itself relegated to the role of a ratifier of changes driven by the cognitive and normative pillars, and has generally been considered static and treated as the same thing as the rule produced by the State (Scott, 2008; McCann, 1994). The case of Faute Inexcusable, an institutionalized practice introduced in 1898 and still in force today, reveals the complexity of a regulative pillar that has a real, and very specific, institutional dynamic. We can only agree with Daudigeos et al. when they stress the importance of paying attention to interaction between institutional pillars in institutional change. Our article focused mainly on the regulative pillar, such that we do not propose any contribution regarding interactions between pillars and their mutual effects – that was not our research project. However, our contribution to the understanding – and a form of intellectual rehabilitation – of the regulative pillar paves the way for a broader research agenda explicitly aimed at exploring the interaction dynamic between the pillars, without claiming to answer it comprehensively.",0,test,324
145695740,"Background and Aim: The communication process includes both verbal and nonverbal elements. Nonverbal behavior or body language includes facial expression, eye contact, posture and prosody. Prosody conveys semantic or affective information to a listener. Nonetheless, so far in Iran no report on assessment of speech prosody comprehension in patients has ever been published. The aim of this study was to measure the validity and reliability of the prosody comprehension test specifically designed for the Persian language and culture. Methods: This study is a type of test development. 73 sentences were orated by 22 professional vocalists in eight different prosodies. A total of 6582 voices were prepared which were listened by 200, 18-30 year-old students and a voice specialist. Having the content validity calculated for all voices, 1473 voices were found to be unanimously agreed upon by all participants in terms of emotional status which were analyzed by a voice specialist. Eventually, 169 voices were selected for developing the prosody comprehension test including the following four subtests: none motional prosody discrimination, emotional discrimination, naming of prosody and naming conflicts. Reliability of the test was determined by performing the test on 32, 18-60 year-old normal people. Results: The designed test of comprehension prosody had 100% content validity ratio and 94% reliability and the correlation of test of prosody was 89% (p=0.001). Conclusion: This test in Persian language has appropriate validity and reliability and is appropriate for assessment of prosody comprehension.",1,test,238
4814796,"PURPOSE ::: In this study, the impact of contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scan interpretations by emergency medicine team on patients' morbidity and mortality was evaluated and their interpretations were compared to radiologists' reports. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: During a 3-month period, all patients who had undergone a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scan at the emergency department enrolled in this study. All CT scans were interpreted blindly by the emergency medicine (ED) attending physicians and the patients were treated accordingly. Radiologists reported all the CT scans within 12 h. Radiologists' reports were put into the agreement or disagreement group retrospectively. A panel of experts further evaluated the disagreement groups' medical charts and placed them in clinically significant or insignificant group based on the follow-up for 28 days. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In this study, 170 CT scans were interpreted. The agreement rate was 68.2%. In the clinically significant disagreement group, eight patients did not receive the required treatment and three patients were over treated. Although the overall mortality rate was 5, none could have been prevented by a prompt radiologist's report. The disagreement group had longer hospital stay (p = 0.006) and transfer to other wards (p = 0.035). The inter-rater reliability between emergency medicine attending physicians and attending radiologists was substantial (kappa = 0.77) and statistically significant (p < 0.0001). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our findings support the cautious use of ED physicians' CT scan interpretations for patients' management. Ideally, the ED physicians should utilize a real-time radiologist interpretation in critical patients. This collaboration will result in better patient management.",1,test,261

Because excellence appears neutral, natural, universal, and a legitimate educational goal, it obfuscates the embedded assumptions that undergird the material practices associated with performances of excellence. These assumptions include the quantification and commensurability of learning, teaching, and scholarship, the necessity of assessment and legitimation of accountability regimes, and the naturalness and universality of competition within postsecondary education.

The authors asked Portuguese-speaking preschool children in Brazil (mean age 4 year 3 months) to spell 12 words. Monte Carlo tests were used to identify the 31 children whose writing was not based on spellings or sounds of the target words. Two and a half years later, the children took a standardized spelling test. The more closely the digram (two-letter sequence) frequencies in the preschool task correlated with those in children’s books, the better scores the children had in primary school, and the more preschoolers used letters from their own name, the lower their subsequent scores. Thus, preschoolers whose prephonological writing revealed attentiveness to the statistical properties of text subsequently performed better in conventional spelling. These analytic techniques may help in the early identification of children at risk for spelling difficulties.",1,test,146

Society then becomes comprised of what Gergen (1999) describes as isolated souls who are doomed to enter and leave the world as self with everyone else defined as other and therefore different and separate from. It is this deification of the self that has led to what I have come to view as the theology of individualism that dominates Western culture often to the exclusion of community and which has such damaging and isolating effects on individuals, particularly Indigenous students (Kinnane, 2014).

55510836,"We analyze the impact of information frictions on workers' wages, contributing to the literature that tested search theory, which has so far focused on labor market frictions in general and not specifically on information asymmetries. Using data for 16 countries from the European Social Survey 2008, we find a sizeable gap between workers' perceptions of the unemployment rate and the actual unemployment rate in the country, which is a meaningful indicator of their misperception of labor market tightness. To handle the interval nature of our outcome of interest, the earnings variable, we estimate interval regressions, as well as ordered probit models. We follow a threefold strategy to tackle potential endogeneity problems, as the model includes: controls for the worker's ability; country-specific fixed effects; the unemployment rate in the region of residence, which might be the benchmark respondents have in mind when reporting their perception of the national unemployment rate and which is known to influence regional wages. Results show that when subjective perceptions overstate the unemployment rate in the country, a one percentage point gap between the perceived and the actual unemployment rate reduces individual wages by 0.4 to 0.7 percent. We discuss a potential mechanism generating this result. A pessimistic view of the labor market leads to concern over own future employment prospects and is thus likely to lower reservation wages; a too optimistic view, in turn, could raise reservation wages, but it would render job finding more difficult.",1,test,240

157669384,"In a study about the music activities delivered by selected Victorian primary school classroom generalist teachers, the phrase ‘lost and found’ had several apt connotations. Firstly, music activities delivered by generalists were found to be ‘lost’ attributed to the minimal data kept at the government level about primary music education programs (Parliament of Victoria, 2013). A goal of the study was to document some of those seemingly missing music activities. Secondly, the generalists who delivered music activities in the course of day-to-day teaching, prospective participants in the study, were difficult to find. It appeared that generalists delivering music activities may indeed be ‘lost’ due to a lack of “skills and confidence” (Parliament of Victoria, 2013, p. 19) or submerged in the crowded curriculum (Parliament of Victoria, 2013). Through purposeful sampling, three participants were ‘found’ who demonstrated commitment and enthusiasm for delivering music activities. Thirdly, the findings revealed that the music learning outcomes inherent in the music activities delivered by participants were often de-emphasised or ‘lost’ in the integrated activities favoured by participants. Overall however, the findings indicated a variety of music activities delivered by participants and upon close examination, aspects of best practice pedagogy were ‘found’.",1,test,196

The aim of this study was to systematically test if these two aspects interact with each other. In Studies 1 and 2, we created hypothetical charity appeals related to the Syrian refugee crisis and factorially manipulated characteristics of victims possible to help (one identified child/nine non-identified children) and presence of statistical information about the scope and nature of the problem (information-box absent/present). We found a significant interaction effect both when using self-rated helping intention (Study 1), and when using actual donation behavior as the dependent variable (Study 2). Statistical information decreased helping intentions toward a single identified child but had no, or even a small positive effect on helping nine non-identified children. In Study 3, non-student participants reading a charity appeal with both a story about one identified child and statistical information donated less often than participants reading appeals with either only a story about one identified child or only statistical information. We suggest that both emotional arguments (e.g., a story and picture of an identified child in need) and analytical arguments (e.g., detailed statistical information about the scope and nature of the problem) can make us more motivated to help refugees, but that mixing different argument-types can make charity appeals internally inconsistent and decrease donations.",0,test,234

Design/Methodology/Approach An action research approach was adopted involving two research initiatives; firstly, a survey to elicit stakeholders’ understanding of sustainable local food, with a view to creating a shared agenda and informing future strategic direction; and secondly a combination of research approaches, including paired discussions, generation of pictorial outputs and a workshop, aimed to inform the future vision and mission of the Partnership. Findings Collaboration with stakeholders through a variety of research initiatives has facilitated the development of a Sustainable Food City Partnership, with the overarching aim of achieving a transition towards a more sustainable food system. Moreover, collaboration has contributed to the transition of the Partnership to ensure sustainability and continuity after the initial funding stage. Research limitations/implications While universities have an important role to play in guiding direction and shaping new community initiatives for sustainability in their regions, the challenges, resources and time involved may be under-estimated; these projects take considerable time to yield fruit.

Contrasting literature with behavioral observations, we seek a better behavioral understanding andthus comprehensive solutions for their welfare enhancement. Over the past 6 years, we have assessed physical and behavioral welfare in over 900 mules by surveying owners from Egypt, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and the U.S. These mules participated in shows, brick kiln work, cart-pulling, packing, tourism, and cattle herding. Observations are discussed alongside facts from the literature. Unfortunately, their behavior has been misunderstood by many, and harsh treatment and equipment has been used to control them. Few studies have attempted to define or use learning theory to understand how and why mules and hinnies behave as they do. Hence, understanding their health considerations, natural behavior, and training theory is crucial for those who work with them.Solutions to welfare improvement partially lie in an individual’s ability to handle mules and hinnies from birth, and to proceed slowly through training.

His unadulterated words aptly describe modern problems across geographical borders and, in this case, income levels. This attests to his timeless insight and understanding.

To better delineate this, the authors reviewed all articles from 2000 to 2014 pertaining to the treatment of patellar tendinopathy, focusing namely on treatment of recalcitrant cases. Open and arthroscopic techniques were found to achieve similar satisfactory results in 81% (range, 45%-100%) and 91% (range, 86%-96%) of patients, respectively.

199309013,"In Australia, successive governments have sought to extinguish 'native title', preferring English feudal socage, but not the Australian Indigenous systems of land title. Australian governments want courts, constituted overwhelmingly by non-indigenous lawyers, to decide land disputes as for feudal socage. Therefore, this article suggests a need to understand this attempted radical reframing of Australian Indigenous titles to land, through the convenient lens of Goffman's frame analysis. The research question is whether Anglo-Australian frame transformation of the Indigenous land titles into mere religion, song and art, extinguishes land title. The article tries to show that Australian indigenous land title is communal allodial title, as a bundle of subsisting rights by operation of Australian Continental Common Law, which therefore cannot be extinguished by the fraud inherent in frame transformation. Indigenous land title is true communal allodial title, beset by a fraudulent colonial occupation, suggesting a lack of internal reason in colonial policy and administration. Successive governments have tried to frame transform the highly sophisticated and ancient indigenous legal and social system, including sophisticated celestial mapping and navigation systems, into mere religious art. This frame transformation is reversible by epideictic rhetoric. The Indigenous system is transmitted phylogenetically, in which governance government officials can have no participation. Indigenous land title cannot be extinguished.",0,test,209

It aims to understand the importance of aesthetic literacy for the development of reading and writing of young and adult students in rural education from readings and comic books productions. This study is based on Cultural-Historical theory and has as a method the Didactic-Formative Experiment. The data recording instruments used in the research are the field records of observations made in the classroom, the audio recording of interviews with the students, as well as visual records of the comic books produced by the students and classes recordings in videos. For data analysis, we will follow the perspective of Dialectical Historical Materialism. When considering reading and writing as social and cultural practices, literacy is fundamental in the educational process.

First, images represent strategies used by therapists in order to simplify the most abstract theoretical concepts. Second, images provide a system according for organizing the information about a client and anticipate the patterns of client change. Within the theoretical frameworks of social representations and of goal directed action theory, the present study explores the metaphorical aspects linked with therapeutic knowledge. This study aims to reconstruct the social representations that therapists use to objectify their theoretical model. The present research relies on a qualitative methodology.

62754285,"As a scientist develops, a referencing system (linking results/hypotheses to sources) evolves in the mind. This mind-map is an essential working tool that uses indexing features—such as author names—as reference points. The Harvard style (HS), in which citations in the text are made of names and years of publication and the references are listed in alphabetical order, actively helps to establish this mind-map. In our view, the Vancouver style (VS), in which citations in the text are numbers and the references are listed in order of appearance within the text, does not enhance the formation of a mind-map in a similar way and makes detections of incongruity between the reader’s mind-map and the text more difficult. In an ideal academic world, HS would be used because of these two effects: constant education of and easy quality control by the scientific reader. Although VS reduces printing space and allows easier reading for less academically trained readers, scientific readers may find this style difficult when trying to check and verify sources. For reviewers, who cannot opt not to make such checks, VS is even more tedious. We advocate that journals using VS in print should use HS for the reviewing process; further, in the final printed version, the references should be numbered and listed alphabetically rather than according to the order in which they are cited. Especially for maturing scientists, reading texts with HS referencing is essential.",1,test,235

Planning for sustainable development requires integrating conflicting criteria on economy, energy, environment and social aspects. In this paper, we introduce a Weighted Goal Programming model involving criteria on the economic development (GDP), the electricity consumption, the greenhouse gas emissions, and the total number of employees to determine optimal labor allocation across various economic sectors. The proposed model is validated with data from the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates).

142102705,"This article explores the impact of varied migration trajectories and settlement experiences on the ways in which diaspora Croats have engaged with the homeland and with each other. The pre-migration experiences of Croats over the past century, spanning imperial and fascist periods, socialism, the Yugoslav Wars of Succession, and independence, combined with the struggles and challenges of life in Canada, have all but defined the lives of diaspora Croats for generations. This is reflected not only in the particularities of different migration waves, opportunity structures, and other barometers of diaspora adaptation but in the effects of major upheavals and transformations in the “place of origin,” variously defined as empire, nation, republic, region, or domovina (homeland). Disparities among and between different generations of Croats are typically conceived of as political/ideological. This tendency, though driven largely by the tumultuous history of the former Yugoslavia, overlooks the complex dynamics underlying significant social, cultural, and other conflicts and contestations within diaspora Croat communities, many of which were on full display during the Homeland War, a time when the “thousand-year-old dream” of Croatian independence was to unite all Croats globally. The implications of the Croatian case for thinking about generation are found in the constant and, at times, fraught engagements of diaspora Croats with their homeland.",0,test,211

First, in 1969 the encounter between early homophile organizing and the New Left produced gay liberation and its signature contribution - coming out. Second, the sudden decline of the New Left in the early 1970s reduced the viability of the radical gay-liberation goal of societal transformation and prompted gay activists to redirect their movement to the affirmation of gay identity and the pursuit of gay rights.

A systematic review was conducted to determine the effectiveness of health promotion interventions that target social isolation and loneliness among older people. Quantitative outcome studies between 1970 and 2002 in any language were included. Articles were identified by searching electronic databases, journals and abstracts, and contacting key informants. Information was extracted and synthesised using a standard form. Thirty studies were identified and categorised as ‘group ’ (n=17) ; ‘ one-toone ’ (n=10) ; ‘service provision’ (n=3) ; and ‘ community development ’ (n=1). Most were conducted in the USA and Canada, and their design, methods, quality and transferability varied considerably. Nine of the 10 effective interventions were group activities with an educational or support input. Six of the eight ineffective interventions provided one-to-one social support, advice and information, or health-needs assessment.

The package of a product has a high propensity of attracting a first time buyer of a beauty product who has no prior contact of the product. In the same way, it can also turn away the first buyer too. Packaging actually serves many purposes, ranging from product protection to attracting consumer attention. It is the selling tool that should promote and sell the product by catching consumers attention, defining the product’s identity, providing information, ensuring safe use and protecting the product. This study therefore seek to find out how much the package of a beauty product goes into the decision making process of the consumer. A non probability sampling method was used to select the sample size. A sample size of 50 consisting of 40 users of beauty product and 10 sellers of beauty product in the New Juaben Municipality was used. The findings made in the research were that, females have the highest percentage when it comes to beauty product usage, whiles users of beauty product mostly prefer a rubber containers, consumers consider the package of a beauty product before they make a purchase, and the level of influence packaging have on the consumers’ buying decision was high. However, majority said that packaging does not guarantee quality, but rather packaging does help in the following ways; catching consumers attention, defining the product identity, and protecting the product. It is therefore recommended at the end of the research that manufacturers and retailers must not under play the role that packaging plays in bringing consumers to a particular product.",1,test,279

158058049,"This paper presents an analysis of the land use and land cover change (LUCC) of major infrastructure construction as exemplified by the case of Hangzhou International Airport (HIA, Hangzhou, China), which is one of the busiest airports in Eastern China. The airport’s effect on LUCC is evaluated by comparing the actual pattern from 1996 to 2001 with a counterfactual simulated land use pattern that would have occurred without the intervention of airport construction. This research is based on land use maps from Landsat images that were analyzed by supervised classification and visual interpretation. To simulate the land use pattern occurring without airport construction, the counterfactual, we applied a cellular automata (CA)–Markov model. Through before and after comparison, we found that cultivated land has decreased and that constructed land has increased because of airport construction. However, according to the counterfactual scenario, airport construction to some extent prevented a decrease in cultivated land and decelerated the expansion of constructed land at a small scale and in the short term. We discuss several reasons for this result, including governmental regulations, such as the setting of the airport clearance area for the safety of plane take-off and landing, the adverse effects of aviation noise or pollution, which may limit the construction activities in the surrounding areas of the airport, and, importantly, the unique land use and land management system in China, mainly the cultivated land requisition-compensation balance policy. We conclude that (1) the counterfactual CA–Markov model simulation is a suitable and unbiased way of evaluating the effect of infrastructure on LUCC that can solve the deficiency in the previous literature relying on before and after comparisons and (2) regulatory, economic, and institutional factors should be considered when explaining and assessing the LUCC due to large infrastructure projects, such as airports, in China and in other countries.",1,test,302

A geometrically focused piston transducer is used as the acoustic source. Signals are cross-correlated to find the true sound speed during the measurement to make the simulated and measured pulses in phase for comparisons. The calculated sound speed in the measurement is varied between 1487.45 m/s and 1487.75 m/s by using different initial values in the ASA simulation. Results from the pulsed ASA simulations using both Field II simulated and hydrophone measured acoustic sources are compared to the Field II simulated and hydrophone measured pulses, respectively. The total relative root mean square (RMS) errors of the pulsed ASA are investigated by using different time-point, zero-padding factors, spatial sampling interval and temporal sampling frequency in the simulation. Optimal parameters for the ASA are found in the simulation. The RMS error of the ASA simulation is reduced from 10.9% to 2.4% for the optimal parameters when comparing to Field II simulations. The comparison between the ASA calculated and measured pulses are illustrated and the corresponding RMS error is 25.4%.",1,test,187

The methodology is based on a taxonomy of policy components as developed by Howlett and Cashore. The data come from comprehensive country studies for Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam and interviews with policymakers. We find that each country has a specific set of goals, objectives and targets that support sustainable transport, and, directly or indirectly, climate change mitigation. In terms of specific mechanisms and calibrations, which we analyse based on the Avoid−Shift−Improve approach, there are notable differences between the countries, for example in terms of fuel economy policy. Even though an initial response to climate change mitigation challenges is visible in these countries’ transport policies, much more effort is required to enable a transition to a transport system compatible with long-term climate change and sustainable development targets.",1,test,180

No bias in interpretation is observed when the masked prime is a word that is semantically related to the target with no morphological relationship (e.g., glue), though such a semantically based bias is revealed when the prime is unmasked. Because the masked priming results cannot be explained in terms of facilitation of processing at either the form level or the semantic level, it is concluded that an intermediate level provides the locus of the effect, referred to here as the ‘lemma’ level. Thus, any model of lexical processing needs to incorporate such an intermediate level to capture the relationship between stem morphemes and their derived forms.",0,test,136

142801498,"In their review, Ablon, Levy, and Smith-Hansen (2011) showed that the Psychotherapy Process Q-set (PQS; Jones, 2000) has been applied to a large range of studies with different methods and aims, from Randomized Control Trials (RCT) to naturalistic studies and single-case designs. Focusing on our colleagues’ work, we will highlight the contribution of the PQS to research in psychotherapy, not only in process-outcome studies, but also into the therapeutic action debates, the specific vs common factors discussion, and the insight vs relation dialect. According to our studies, PQS has played the most relevant and innovative role in psychoanalysis. Ablon et al. showed how Jones left the clinical inheritance of his empirical method. One of PQS’s strengths deals with the Q-sort methodology (Block, 1961; Stephenson, 1953) that enables both an empirical study of human subjectivity (McKnown & Thomas, 1988) and the application of rigorous data analysis for single-case designs, such as the P-technique and time series analysis. PQS, as colleagues have shown, is useful in single-case designs that, despite their limitations in the generalization of the findings (Kazdin, 2002), capture the richness and complexity of the clinical dialogue and describe the uniqueness of the patient and therapist dyad and interaction structures.",1,test,200

However, some research has indicated that exercise has an immediate impact on body image. The aims of this study were to investigate the immediate effects of aerobic exercise in a fitness class and the at-home environment on body image, and to examine the impact of nutritional status (i.e., normal weight vs. overweight/obesity) and exercise addiction on these changes. Method 322 Hungarian women participated in the study with two different environmental conditions, fitness class condition (N = 155) and at-home video condition (N = 167). They completed the Body Appreciation Scale and Exercise Addiction Inventory before and after a one-hour aerobic exercise session.

150907852,"Abstract : It is a well established axiom that attempting to defeat an insurgency or a terrorist organization head-on is merely treating the symptoms of a problem. For long-term success, the campaign must also address the root causes of the insecurity that spawned conflict in the first place. In this monograph, British academic and practitioner Dr. Shima Keene describes a number of ways in which financial intelligence can be leveraged not only to disrupt adversary activities, but also to provide indicators and warnings of future actions and, ultimately, to address underlying insecurities. Dr. Keene was previously both a banker and a British Army reservist. In this monograph, she uses her expertise as a threat finance specialist to outline specific areas where financial intelligence analysis techniques, which are common in the private sector, can be applied to combating insurgency, terrorism, and other hard security threats. Dr. Keene argues that financial disruption techniques used in counterinsurgency have been poorly coordinated and at times counterproductive, and cites the targeting of the Hawala money transfer system as a specific example. Instead, she notes intelligence derived from analysis of financial data can provide much greater value in both understanding and predicting the adversary s activities, as well as providing for precise targeting to disrupt them. The Strategic Studies Institute recommends this monograph not only to counterinsurgency and counterterrorism practitioners and policymakers, but also to the Intelligence community more widely; all of these will find its conclusions on the handling of financial data and the value of threat finance analysis valuable.",0,test,255

To place Gert’s contributions in context, we argue first that household panel surveys deserve to be praised for what they contribute to science and to public policy, forming a crucial component in a portfolio of different types of longitudinal data. Second, we show that the SOEP is a very successful example of a household panel survey, comparing its characteristics and innovations with those of its counterparts from other countries. Our case is that the SOEP is truly special (it is a Sonder-Panel) – and Gert Wagner has been responsible for much of this success. He is truly a Sonder-Panel-Papa.",1,test,118

The researchers intend to explore motives and hidden factors, especially the locus of internal and external control attribution and sensation-seeking perspective through investigating the related papers. In recent years, many papers related to Internet addiction pop up like mushroom and bamboo shoots after rain. Most of them stressed unduly the negative or problematic behavior and rarely mentioned the positive exploration. Hence, to visit scenic spots and to understand the truth, researchers devote ambition to construct the motive theory and to explain network behavior intended to unearth its implication on the general technology education. Study group discovered that the motive theory concerning network behavior was based on inquiring and searching of related data. After clarification, the questionnaire for empirical study was composed. There were 574 students selected as the testing samples from four universities. The results showed that the MSMT had a great mysterious extent from beginning to end, and also obtained the interaction with one another among flow experience, peak phenomenon, and Internet addiction. We established MSMT for the instruction of general technology education. If teachers could handle the information of network learning and explore the truth to solve the problem, then students would enhance their on-line learning and pursue for truth. Finally, several suggestions were proposed: to compile a more rigid questionnaire; to spread the MSMT; to occupy the status of general technology education; to keep track of more understanding on similar study.",1,test,261

Recent research, however, points towards the need for a supplementary approach, which includes the consumer behaviour of the household. This approach necessarily has to work from below and include the citizens, as it is their daily practices that have to be challenged. This article reviews selected literature and studies on whether compact cities leads to more sustainable cities, and it use lifestyle interpretations of urbane forms to challenge the compact cities approach.

18142553,"Bats are natural reservoirs for the majority of lyssaviruses globally, and are unique among mammals in having exceptional sociality and longevity. Given these facets, and the recognized status of bats as reservoirs for rabies viruses (RABVs) in the Americas, individual bats may experience repeated exposure to RABV during their lifetime. Nevertheless, little information exists with regard to within-host infection dynamics and the role of immunological memory that may result from abortive RABV infection in bats. In this study, a cohort of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) was infected intramuscularly in the left and right masseter muscles with varying doses [10−0.1–104.9 median mouse intracerebral lethal doses (MICLD50)] of an E. fuscus RABV variant isolated from a naturally infected big brown bat. Surviving bats were infected a second time at 175 days post-(primary) infection with a dose (103.9–104.9 MICLD50) of the same RABV variant. Surviving bats were infected a third time at either 175 or 305 days post-(secondary) infection with a dose (104.9 MICLD50) of the same RABV variant. When correcting for dose, similar mortality was observed following primary and secondary infection, but reduced mortality was observed following the third and last RABV challenge, despite infection with a high viral dose. Inducible RABV-neutralizing antibody titres post-infection were ephemeral among infected individuals, and dropped below levels of detection in several bats between subsequent infections. These results suggest that long-term repeated infection of bats may confer significant immunological memory and reduced susceptibility to RABV infection.",1,test,241

Technological progress has increased the importance of the international division of labor and of global production and distribution networks. Multinational corporatios have been a driving force behind these developments. As a transition economy, Poland provides an interesting case for study, as its sudden opening to foreign investment after a long period of isolation allows the process of integratio into global networks to be studies more clearly. Using Poland as a case study, the authors study multinational corporatios'role in integrating a host country into the increasingly international division of labor. They provide evidence that inflows of foreign direct investment are increasing Poland's participation in global production and distribution networks. They conclude that because of the large volume of foreign direct investment inflows expected in Poland in the near future, Poland's exports--driven by fragmented production production--will continue to expand at even faster rates than observed there recently.",0,test,188
19235192,"We examine differences in rates of 30-day readmissions across patients by race/ethnicity and the extent to which these differences were moderated by insurance coverage. We use hospital discharge data of patients in the 18 years and above age group for 5 US states, California, Florida, Missouri, New York, and Tennessee for 2009, the latest year prior to the start of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Hospital Compare program of public reporting of hospital performance on 30-day readmissions. We use logistic regression models by state to estimate the association between insurance status, race, and the likelihood of a readmission within 30 days of an index hospital admission for any cause. Overall in 5 states, non-Hispanic blacks had a slightly higher risk of 30-day readmissions relative to non-Hispanic whites, although this pattern varied by state and insurance coverage. We found higher readmission risk for non-Hispanic blacks, compared with non-Hispanic whites, among those covered by Medicare and private insurance, but lower risk among uninsured and similar risk among Medicaid. Hispanics had lower risk of readmissions relative to non-Hispanic whites, and this pattern was common across subgroups with private, Medicaid, and no insurance coverage. Uninsurance was associated with lower risk of readmissions among minorities but higher risk of readmissions among non-Hispanic whites relative to private insurance. The study found that risk of readmissions by racial ethnic groups varies by insurance status, with lower readmission rates among minorities who were uninsured compared with those with private insurance or Medicare, suggesting that lower readmission rates may not always be construed as a good outcome, because it could result from a lack of insurance coverage and poor access to care, particularly among the minorities.",1,test,278

Both the United States (US) and China form an intrinsic part of South Asia’s geopolitical security architecture through their embeddedness with both Pakistan and India. Historically, Pakistan relied on both American and Chinese security assistance in balancing against India while India relied more on the former Soviet Union and the US in its balancing game against Pakistan. As current geopolitical dynamics unfold with the US pivot to Asia, the rivalry and competition between the US and China is intensifying, bringing with it a similar dynamic in South Asia as Pakistan moves closer to China and India consolidates its alliance with the US.

Evidence also suggests that metabolism of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor for biological methylation, is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. We investigated the effect of SAM on mtDNA density and insulin sensitivity using the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. To determine the short-term effect on mtDNA density, SAM (15 mg kg -1 d -1 ) was administered intraperitoneally for 7 d to 6 male, 57-wk-old OLETF rats and 6 Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats of the same age as a nondiabetic control. To determine the long-term effect, the same dose of SAM was administered daily to 5 male, 6-wk-old OLETF rats until the age of 25 wk; 7 control OLETF rats received vehicle and 7 LETO rats were untreated. Skeletal muscle mtDNA density was measured by either competitive or multiplex PCR and insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. SAM treatment for 1 wk increased skeletal muscle mtDNA density of both OLETF and LETO rats. The long-term SAM treatment significantly reduced body weight gain as well as increased skeletal muscle mtDNA density and whole body insulin sensitivity in OLETF rats compared with their vehicle-treated controls. Furthermore, in all 3 groups, skeletal muscle mtDNA density correlated with insulin sensitivity (r= 0.752, P < 0.001). In conclusion, SAM treatment increased mtDNA density in the skeletal muscle, improved whole body insulin sensitivity, and prevented body weight gain in OLETF rats.",1,test,261
1518188,"Premature mortality caused by cancer and the public health challenge it represents have given rise to a myriad of studies on the contribution of material and social living conditions to varying risks of morbidity and mortality. Thus, European and American studies have shown that cancer mortality—and some cancers more than others—often hits disadvantaged socioeconomic groups �1-5� and regions �6-7� hardest, and that this relationship persists even when individual behavior �2, 8-9� is taken into account. Numerous studies have focused mainly on men, who are easier to characterize socioeconomically than women. Indeed, it has proven difficult to determine the socioeconomic position of women, and the indicators used are often inadequate �10-11�. An examination of the social health inequalities between the sexes shows that the mortality is sensitive to the inequality measure �12�, the causes of mortality differ for men and women �13-14�, these inequalities are generally less pronounced among women �11, 14-16�, and the social condition of women contributes to health discrepancies between the sexes �17-19�.

167500892,"This paper argues for three basic changes in the model of airport security that have been employed in the United States since the passage of the Air Transportation Security Act (ATSA) legislation in 2001. The changes are to: (1) remove the Transportation Safety Administration's (TSA’s) conflict of interest by making it the policy-maker and regulator, but not the provider, of airport screening; (2) desolve screening responsibility to the airport level, under the supervision of the TSA’s Federal Security Director in each case; and (3) shift the paradigm from an equal-risk model to a genuinely risk-based model of airport security. These changes would improve airport security in many ways. They would target more of the available resources (both people and equipment) toward those passengers who pose relatively greater risk of harm, thereby getting more bang for the buck. By making all on-airport security functions the responsibility of the airport, this approach would lead to a more integrated approach, with the Federal Security Director (FSD) supervising everything.",0,test,165

To identify monetary policy effects on wage inequality between and within firms, we exploit the interaction of nominal interest rate movements around the zero lower bound with variation in pre-determined balance sheet exposure of banks and their lending relations with firms. We find significant increases in credit supply of affected banks, leading to increased within-firm inequality. The results are driven by executives and highest- paid employees reaping relatively greater benefits from positive firm-level credit supply shocks. At the same time, low-paying firms increase their average pay in response to easier credit access.",1,test,136

Jane Jacobs’ thought has been of paramount importance in influencing planning and urban discourses worldwide, but she has not been isolated: in the same years, other critical voices have been shaping a critical thought and fostering debate, on both sides of the Atlantic. Among them, Paul Davidoff, appealing for advocacy planning in NYC, Giancarlo De Carlo, proposing a sharp critique of architectural and planning education in Italy and Reyner Banham and his group, advocating the (paradoxical) possibility of non-planning in the UK. This article proposes to identify a relevant common feature across their positions in the connection between epistemological and political critique; as Jane Jacobs, many critics of traditional technocratic planning underline the inappropriate and ineffective mechanisms of knowledge production and use in urban planning: if cities are characterised by organised complexity (‘intricate social and economic order under the seeming disorder of cities’, as Jacobs puts it), then it is not possible to reduce them to ‘simple problems’.

This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that the term business value in agile contexts is not clearly defined, even though the creation of business value is one of the central themes in agile and lean development. In this paper, we propose a model for business value that is intended to make explicit different factors that constitute the concept of business value in agile and lean software development.

What can we reasonably expect Chinese emissions trends to look like over the next two decades? Secondly, what would be the appropriate policy interventions to flatten Chinese emissions trajectories and reduce the risk of local, regional, and even global adversity? This research is original in its direct use of the new industrial sector-level emissions and energy using data from China to estimate the energy-specific emission effluent rate and its detailed treatment of policies taking account of the three main determinants of pollution intensity: growth, output composition, and technological change. Our results indicate that, without further effective emission control measures, China’s economic growth over the next two decades will contribute significantly to SO2 emission problems, in which the emission increase from the rapid expansion of the transportation service sectors will be the most remarkable. However, detailed examination of the structural and technological components of pollution shows that efficient pollution mitigation can be realized by focused abatement activities, cleaner production, and advances in cleaner fuel products and their use technologies.",1,test,188
18043802,"We use OLS and logistic regression to investigate variation in husband and wife perspectives on the division of authority over agriculture-related decisions within households in rural Tanzania. Using original data from husbands and wives (interviewed separately) in 1,851 Tanzanian households, the analysis examines differences in the wife’s authority over 13 household and farming decisions. The study finds that the level of decision-making authority allocated to wives by their husbands, and the authority allocated by wives to themselves, both vary significantly across households. In addition to commonly considered assets such as women’s age and education, in rural agricultural households women’s health and labor activities also appear to matter for perceptions of authority. We also find husbands and wives interviewed separately frequently disagree with each other over who holds authority over key farming, family, and livelihood decisions. Further, the results of OLS and logistic regression suggest that even after controlling for various individual, household, and regional characteristics, husband and wife claims to decision-making authority continue to vary systematically by decision—suggesting that decision characteristics themselves also matter. The absence of spousal agreement over the allocation of authority (i.e., a lack of “intra-household accord”) over different farm and household decisions is problematic for interventions seeking to use survey data to develop and inform strategies for reducing gender inequalities or empowering women in rural agricultural households. Findings provide policy and program insights into when studies interviewing only a single spouse or considering only a single decision may inaccurately characterize intra-household decision-making dynamics.",1,test,247

The author uses the leading theories and methodology of the Austrian School of Economics to review and critique the definitional construct of the term ""Economics"" as it is commonly used in the literature. The author discusses important concepts central to the nature and understanding of economics as understood by the Austrians, such as: the importance of time preference, economics as a learning system, the importance of entrepreneurialism, value determination, scarcity, the fallacy of the concept of equilibrium, human action and Praxeology, the misapplication of the scientific method and scientism to economics as a social study along with a discussion concerning the relative application of econometrics to the field of study. In doing so he touches upon the classical foundations of Austrian School, being: Methodological Individualism and Methodological Subjectivism.

The data were analysed by Pearson’s productive correlation, stepwise multiple regression and path analysis by the SPSS ver. 20.0 and AMOS ver. 20.0. The results were as follows: First, there were significant negative correlations between directors’ emotional leadership and childcare teachers’ intention to change jobs, and between childcare teachers’ job satisfaction and their intention to change jobs, whereas there were significant positive correlations between directors’ emotional leadership and childcare teachers’ job satisfaction. Second, the directors’ emotional leadership was explained by 22% and the childcare teachers’ job satisfaction was explained by 9% of their intention to change jobs. Last, the childcare teachers’ job satisfaction mediated between the directors’ emotional leadership and childcare teachers’ intention to change jobs.",1,test,210

In particular, the magnitude and influencing factors for head kinematics during the tackle are poorly understood. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to measure head motion of a visually unaware ball carrier during a real game tackle to the upper trunk with no direct head contact, and compare the kinematics with previously reported concussive events. Model-Based Image-Matching was utilised to measure ball carrier head linear and angular velocities. Ball carrier componential maximum change in head angular velocities of 38.1, 20.6 and 13.5 rad/s were measured for the head local X (coronal plane), Y (sagittal plane) and Z (transverse plane) axes respectively. The combination of a high legal tackle height configuration and visually unaware ball carrier can lead to kinematics similar to average values previously reported for concussive direct head impacts.",1,test,158

Most of students still have low speaking ability especially in fluency, pronunciation and comprehension due to inappropriateness in teaching speaking used by the teacher. Therefore many experts of English teaching technique suggest the teacher to apply it as a teaching technique. The objective of the research are to find out whether role play technique can increase the students’ speaking achievement, and improve students’ participation in teaching learning process. ::: The subject of this CAR is the students of the sixth A grade at Al Kautsar Elementary School. This research was conducted in two cycles. The first cycle was done on March 22nd 2014, and the second cycle was done on April 12th 2014. ::: The result of the research shows that: first there is significant increase of students’ speaking achievement from the first cycle to the second cycle. In the first cycle there were 26 students (65%) whose score are up to 70, nevertheless after conducting the second cycle, the students’ speaking achievement increased approximately 35 students (87.5%) are up to 70. It means that there is an improvement in students’ speaking achievement, about 21.5%. ::: In teaching learning process, there is also significant improvement. It can be seen from the first cycle there were 29 (72.5%) out of 40 students who were actively involved in the teaching learning process. Meanwhile in the second cycle there were 38 (95.96%) of students who are actively involved in teaching learning process. It can be conducted that there is an improvement in students’ speaking participation (23.46%) ::: From the data above, the researcher concludes that there is significant increase in students’ speaking ability achievement and students’ participation using role play technique.",1,test,305

45105070,"A rich and distinguished body of research has documented the importance of user innovations. For the most part, this literature has found that users innovate but do not commercialize their innovations. Instead, users benefit from using their innovations and allow manufacturers to commercialize innovations with financial value. Yet scholars have recently shown that entrepreneurial activity by users is more widespread than previously believed. We present data and statistics documenting the prevalence, technological impact, and economic impact of user entrepreneurship. Then, to reconcile these divergent empirical findings, we develop a theoretical model that explains when user innovations are commercialized by users, by manufacturers, or not commercialized at all. At the core of our model is the notion that users and manufacturers differ along two critical dimensions: their estimates of the financial returns to entering the product market, and their profit thresholds. Depending upon the magnitude of these differences, we propose alternative commercialization outcomes. This model helps to explain why user entrepreneurs are likely to spawn the creation of altogether new product markets and even industries. We illustrate our model with examples from the field of consumer sporting goods. The significance of user entrepreneurship and the implications of our model for theories of innovation, entrepreneurship, and industry emergence are discussed.",1,test,208

Sound‐field and public address amplification systems can help to solve this problem by amplifying speech sounds relative to background noise. This study surveyed school classrooms for children with special needs, and compared the performance of a sound‐field and a portable public address system in classroom environments. Unoccupied room noise levels and reverberation times were measured in eight classrooms at four Hong Kong schools for children with special needs. Speech levels in each classroom were measured under three conditions: without amplification, with public address system amplification, and with sound‐field amplification. Speech‐to‐noise ratios were calculated for each condition. Noise and unamplified speech‐to‐noise ratio values exceeded recommended acoustic standards in all classrooms. When sound‐field and public address amplification systems were installed, speech‐to‐noise ratios improved considerably. When either amplification system was used, a uniform sound‐field resulted. The applicability of both types of amplification system and their relative merits in special education classrooms are discussed.",1,test,168

166707232,"The green building market continues to grow, but so do the corresponding legal risks which are only now being explored by scholars and practitioners. Lurking in the shadows behind any green building risk management strategy is how consequential damages should be allocated among the project stakeholders and may emanate from a party's breach of a design, construction, or consulting contract. This allocation is particularly critical on green building projects, whose unique and novel nature can create an increased potential for consequential damages. For example, green building tax credits, premium rents, and even energy savings might fall within the definition of consequential damages, creating disproportionately large liability for parties that fail to protect themselves by contract.However, guidance from the courts on exactly what might constitute green building-related consequential damages is likely years away. Only one lawsuit to date provides any relevant insight, but its applicability is broad, particularly given the pace of green building regulatory activity that continues to take place at the state and local levels. After tracing the history of consequential damages and reviewing their potential sources on green building projects, this Article reviews how major industry organizations have treated the topic in form green building contract exhibits, and suggests general risk management strategies for different green building project stakeholders who allocate the risk of consequential damages in their contracts.",1,test,221

24478484,"Introduction: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most important marker in the detection of prostate cancer, but its reliability is limited by a low specificity. To improve the specificity of PSA, a new parameter, based on the combination of free/total PSA (F/T) with PSA density, is proposed. Materials and Methods: From April 1999 to June 2003, a series of 647 men with high serum PSA levels were submitted to ultrasound-guided multiple prostate biopsies. Total PSA and free PSA were measured by immunoassay (DASIT, Italy). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of PSA density, F/T and (F/T)/PSA density (F/T divided by PSA/prostate volume) were constructed, and relative specificity and sensitivity were calculated. Results: Prostate cancer was present in 284 cases (137 of them with PSA values between 4 and 10 ng/ml), 31 patientshad intraepithelial neoplasia and the remaining cases showed benign prostatic hyperplasia. Analysis of ROC curves in all examined patients showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for (F/T)/PSA density (0.849) was significantly higher than the AUC for F/T (0.681) (p = 0.012). Similar results were observed in the cases with PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml, where the AUC for (F/T)/PSA density (0.768) was significantly higher than the AUC for F/T (0.610) (p = 0.041). In our study, the prostate cancer risk became very high when (F/T)/PSA density values decreased to <1.5. Conclusion: The use of the (F/T)/PSA density ratio may be useful in the detection of prostate cancer, reducing unnecessary prostate biopsies. A cutoff of 1.5 for the (F/T)/PSA density value is recommended for patients with PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml.",1,test,265
159218840,"This chapter describes practitioners’ understanding of excluding illegally obtained evidence. To gain deeper insight into the applicability of the exclusion of evidence obtained through illegal means and to evaluate regulations that have been implemented, fourteen experts from different legal professions (lawyers, judges, prosecutors) and countries (Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan (ROC)) were interviewed about their experiences. All legal systems are faced with the use of illegally obtained evidence. Based on qualitatively analyzed data the frequency of the applicability of exclusionary rules, the types of cases in which they are seen, and experts’ attitudes towards the function of exclusionary rules are described. Violations of rules around the gathering of evidence is a highly sensitive topic, particularly as the state (represented by police officers and prosecutors) plays a central and powerful role. To find out if exclusionary rules do indeed result in a more impartial trial or if further protective measures are required, factors influencing the procurement of evidence and the decision-making process around the legality of such procurement were evaluated. Subsequently, difficulties that law enforcement agencies and criminal courts are faced with were outlined, with an emphasis on the application of the law and the limitations in safeguarding criminal investigations and proceedings. Concluding remarks highlight best practices in securing a fair trial as well as ancillary measures (including unwritten techniques) that may be utilized to optimize the utility of exclusionary rules.",0,test,230

Simulating a general-equilibrium model with incomplete marktes and bankruptcy, we show that for liquidation procedure that does not depreciates the failed assets too much, bankruptcy-liquidation produces better economic results for sectors intensive in physical capital. As the depreciation in liquidation increases and/or the industry sectors are less intensive in physical capital, the availability of reorganization produces better economic results.

159499143,"Regulated marijuana markets are more common today than outright prohibitions across the U.S. states. Advocates for policies that would legalize marijuana recreational markets frequently argue that such laws will eliminate crime associated with the black markets, which many argue is the only link between marijuana use and crime. Law enforcement, however, has consistently argued that marijuana medical dispensaries (regulated retail sale and a common method of medical marijuana distribution), create crime in neighborhoods with these store-fronts. This study offers new insight into the question by exploiting newly collected longitudinal data on local marijuana ordinances within California and thoroughly examining the extent to which counties that permit dispensaries experience changes in violent, property and marijuana use crimes using difference-in-difference methods. The results suggest no relationship between county laws that legally permit dispensaries and reported violent crime. We find a negative and significant relationship between dispensary allowances and property crime rates, although event studies indicate these effects may be a result of pre-existing trends. These results are consistent with some recent studies suggesting that dispensaries help reduce crime by reducing vacant buildings and putting more security in these areas. We also find a positive association between dispensary allowances and DUI arrests, suggesting marijuana use increases in conjunction with impaired driving in counties that adopt these ordinances, but these results are also not corroborated by an event study analysis.",1,test,226

Data from 185 restaurants were collected via Internet, phone interviews, site inspections, and ZAGAT Survey, and analyzed using OLS regression. The log-linear model was found to be most suitable for the data, and the proposed hedonic model accounted for as much as 73.7% of the variation in meal prices. The results indicate that food quality and decor were important determinants of restaurants’ average meal prices while service was not. Furthermore, the study found that a restaurant's location within the building (1st floor), the types of cuisine served (Japanese and Italian), parking facilities, private dining settings, franchising, and the number of blogger reviews (e-WOM) have significant effects on restaurants’ average meal prices. The model will provide useful information for restaurateurs in deciding effective menu pricing strategies.",1,test,147

46886407,"Transfemoral amputation is considered the last treatment option for severe infection, vascular disease, trauma, and malignant tumors of the lower extremity that have failed limb salvage. Unopposed pull of the hip abductors causes a flexion-abduction thigh deformity that results in abnormal biomechanics and increased oxygen consumption during ambulation. Myodesis of the adductor tendons is a critical component of transfemoral amputation that creates dynamic muscle balance, enhances prosthetic fitting and function, and improves clinical outcomes. Traditional adductor myodesis uses locking sutures passed through cortical drill holes along the anterolateral aspect of the distal femur that are tensioned and tied by hand. In this report we describe a novel technique for adductor myodesis using FiberTape suture and knotless anchors that we have found to be quick, easy, and reproducible with strong tendon-bone fixation. ::: ::: ::: LEVEL OF EVIDENCE ::: Level V, expert opinion.",0,test,142

Using questionnaire data obtained from three hundred secondary and tertiary institution's students, this study explored the extent to which these young people are appreciating this trend through finding out their level of occupational and labour market information awareness. The results showed that most of the students are not aware of recent occupational and labour market information trends especially at the secondary level.

73636490,"With the dramatic growing trend toward hookah usage and increased morbidity and mortality caused by smoking, we started a study to research regarding the causes of hookah smoking among teenagers and youth living in Bushehr city. This is a qualitative study. Research environment is considered to be all public places and the research population comprised of all teenagers and youth of Bushehr. 12 participants were selected by purposive sampling. The method of data collection was semi-structured interviews with Participants that were recorded concession and immediately rewritten and analyzed. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data. Data analysis resulted in three main themes including: “the influence of culture”, “prone context”, and “difficulty of quitting”. The most common reasons of increasing use of hookah in Bushehr are: “common culture of using hookah among family and friends”, “lack of enforcement of prohibiting laws about the use of hookah in public”, “lack of knowledge about hookah complications and having the wrong belief about hookah: (being less harmful than smoking)”, “desirable taste and smell of fruity hookahs” and “having no better fun” and “social stress between young people”. The results suggest the public health officials should consider this problem as an urgent priority and along with using effective methods for making the culture and educating people; they should start planning to reduce the consumption. © 2017, Pharmainfo Publications.

2317809,"The retinotectal projection in Xenopus laevis has been shown to exhibit correlation-based refinement of both anatomical and functional connectivity during development. Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is an appealing experimental model for correlation-based synaptic plasticity because, in contrast to plasticity induction paradigms using tetanic stimulation or sustained postsynaptic depolarization, its induction protocol more closely resembles natural physiological activity. In Xenopus tadpoles, where anatomical remodeling has been reported throughout much of the life of the animal, in vivo retinotectal STDP has only been examined under a limited set of experimental conditions. Using perforated patch recordings of retina-evoked EPSCs in tectal neurons, we confirmed that repeatedly driving a retinotectal EPSP 5-10 ms prior to inducing an action potential in the postsynaptic cell, reliably produced timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP) of the retinotectal synapse in young wild type tadpoles (stages 41-44). At these stages, retinotectal timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) also could be induced by evoking an EPSP to arrive 5-10 ms after an action potential in the tectal cell. However, retinotectal STDP using this standard protocol was limited to a developmental sensitive period, as we were unable to induce t-LTP or t-LTD after stage 44. Surprisingly, this STDP protocol also failed to induce reliable STDP in albino tadpoles at the early ages when it was effective in wild type pigmented animals. Nonetheless, low-frequency flashes to the eye produced a robust NMDA receptor-dependent retinotectal LTD in stage 47 albino tadpoles, demonstrating that the retinotectal synapse can nonetheless be modified in these animals using different plasticity paradigms.",1,test,250

Recently, associations of elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations in the acute phase and of MTHFR 677 TT genotype with spontaneous cervical artery dissections (sCAD) have been reported. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis in the currently largest sample of patients with sCAD, taking into account known factors influencing plasma homocysteine levels. Ninety-five patients with past sCAD were compared with 95 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. Homocysteine, vitamin B6, B12, folate, and polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T), cystathionine β-synthase (CBS 844ins68bp) and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase/formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1 G1958A) were assessed and any associations were analysed using multivariate statistics. The occurrence of sCAD was associated with elevated homocysteine levels with an odds ratio of 1.327 per 20 % percentile. Homocysteine levels were influenced by gender, smoking status, occurrence of hypertension, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and by the MTHFR TT genotype. MTHFR, CBS 844ins68bp, and MTHFD1 G1958A genotype were not independently associated with the occurrence of sCAD.

5656406,"Electronic commerce has become increasingly popular. Although it brings significant convenience to people's lives, a purchaser often hesitates to provide a negative rating to a merchant (or commodity) after a bad online shopping experience because his sensitive information (e.g., address, telephone number, and email address) would be available to the merchant. This makes the purchaser uncomfortable and even unsafe, and the purchaser tends to contribute better but untrue ratings. Hence, the privacy of the purchaser's score is vitally important to the development of electronic commerce. In this study, we apply for the first time an artificial immune technique (i.e., the negative survey) to rate the credits of online merchants, and we propose a new credit rating model, called a negative rating model, that could preserve the privacy of the purchaser's score with low additional computational cost. Moreover, the results obtained from our credit rating model exhibited a high correlation with those from the traditional evaluation model.

154788600,"Major changes have been challenging journalism in the last two decades, in the context of the ‘digital age’. The technological possibilities developed in the ‘information society’, together with the social and cultural trend for more participation, opened this field to new actors, which caused professional journalists to lose their traditional monopoly of searching, gathering, editing and diffusing news in the public sphere. At the same time, these new possibilities of communicating are increasingly forcing the old actors to play new roles in the media. The digital techniques and the Internet gave birth to a big diversity of new media and of new forms of dealing with journalism and public information. ‘Citizen journalism’, ‘participatory journalism’, ‘user-generated content’, ‘crowdsourcing’, ‘weblogs’,‘ Twitter’, ‘Facebook’, etc., are words and expressions rather common these days, all of them somehow calling the attention to the fact that journalism-as-a-professional-activity seems to coexist more and more with various forms of journalismas-a-civic-activity , performed by very different people, under very different conditions and with very different levels of involvement and expertise. As a consequence, questions are being raised about the ethical implications of this new scenario, both in what regards the activity of professional journalists in new (online) media and the active commitment of ‘laypersons’ in the process of gathering, editing and diffusing information. In this paper we will try to analyze and to discuss these questions, with reference, among others, to Eliot Freidson (2004) and his distinction between ‘practice ethics’ and ‘institutional ethics’. Furthermore, we’ll try to discuss what really makes journalism distinctive from other practices that nowadays coexist with it in the public sphere, strongly increasing the possibilities of communication between people but not necessarily following the purposes of public interest and of civic democratic participation.

29554851,"German energy policy targets envision a share of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) of at least 80% in 2050. How can the transformation of the German electricity sector be achieved and at what costs? This paper addresses these questions by means of a meta-analysis of 10 recent model-based mitigation scenarios for Germany. It turns out that the scenarios exploit the three basic strategic options of increasing the share of RES-E – domestic RES-E generation, electricity demand reductions, and RES-E imports – to substantially different extents. Domestic RES-E generation increases in all scenarios, particularly from onshore and offshore wind. Scenarios that rely heavily on reducing electricity demand require a relatively low expansion of domestic RES-E generation. Despite detailed technical analyses, insights on the costs of the transformation remain limited. A discussion of underlying scenario assumptions reveals that it is unclear whether (i) RES-E and system integration technology development will be as cost-competitive as postulated, (ii) implicitly assumed institutional requirements will be realized, and (iii) relevant actors in the transformation process will be incentivized accordingly. Therefore, future research should pursue a thorough assessment of strategic options for transforming the German electricity system that consistently integrates technologies, institutions, and actors.",1,test,198

In the small intestine of all mice 1 hour after inoculation, immunoreactivity with antinormal prion protein (PrPc) antibody was seen in the cytoplasm of villus enterocytes. This finding suggests transmission of abnormal PrPsc into the cytoplasm of enterocytes. In control mice treated with normal sheep brain, no PrPc signal was seen in enterocytes of the small intestine. Immunopositivity for neurofilament protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein was seen in the cytoplasm of enterocytes of mice inoculated with scrapie and normal sheep brain.

This decline has been largely driven by a 17 percentage point reduction in the proportion of high school dropouts working even a single week per year. One common explanation for this trend, declining real wages, ignores the fact that the value of working today depends on future returns to experience. This paper estimates a model of labor supply with returns to experience as an explanatory variable, using data from the Current Population Survey. The classic myopic labor supply model (in which only the current wage matters) is rejected in favor of one that includes forward-looking considerations, embodied in returns to experience.

We investigate how investment behavior changes when investment is subject to time-to-build versus when it is not. We characterize equilibrium investment strategies under several information structures and compare results to the social optimum. We offer some new results. The model predicts that, controlling for demand, and production and investment costs, investments and outputs can be higher in progressive industries (which often exhibit time-to-build) than in fast-paced industries (where time-to-build is insignificant). Furthermore, for both investment types (investment with or without time-to-build) we offer a novel equilibrium in which firms incrementally invest. This behavior is driven by demand uncertainty and capacity constraints. Also, expected outputs are lower than Cournot outputs as firms face uncertainty. Moreover, the amount of uncertainty has different effects over investment types.",1,test,158

From a community-based perspective, action is critical to the development of a community’s identity. This outlook suggests that participation determines community membership. Accordingly, conventional community limits may be transformed. The purpose of this article is to offer an understanding of how community-based planners may be viewed to be community members. The focus is the various perspectives on community and their respective implications for membership. To begin, the traditional perspective of community that is grounded in realism is presented. A community-based outlook based on participation is then provided. Subsequently recognized is the importance of dialogue, which is an underdeveloped and, at times, overlooked strategy in community-based practice. The connection between the planner and community is later described, followed by an examination of the issue of power. To conclude, an emphasis is placed on the possibility for a planner to become a community member when a project follows community-based philosophy.",0,test,202

A unique solution to such models is shown to exist under certain measurability conditions. Stochastic Euler equations, whose existence is normally assumed in these models, are then formally derived. The regularity conditions are weak, and economically innocuous. The results apply to the broad range of discrete-time monetary and financial models that are special cases of the model used in this paper. The method is also applicable to other dynamic models that incorporate contemporaneous uncertainty.",0,test,92
34380384,"Most strategies for selection portfolios focus on utilizing solely market data and implicitly assume that stock markets communicate all relevant information to all market stakeholders, and that these markets cannot be influenced by investor activities. However convenient, this is a limited approach, especially when applied to small and illiquid markets such as the Croatian market, where such assumptions are hardly realistic. Thus, there is a demand for including other sources of data, such as financial reports. Research poses the question of whether financial ratios as criteria for stock selection are of any use to Croatian investors. Financial and market data from selected publicly companies listed on the Croatian capital market are used. A two-stage portfolio selection strategy is applied, where the first stage involves selecting stocks based on the respective Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) efficiency scores. DEA models are becoming popular in stock portfolio selection given that the methodology includes numerous models that provide a great flexibility in selecting inputs and outputs, which in turn are considered as criteria for portfolio selection. Accordingly, there is much room for improvement of the current proposed strategies for selecting portfolios. In the second stage, two portfolio-weighting strategies are applied using equal proportions and scoreweighting. To show whether these strategies create outstanding out–of–sample portfolios in time, time-dependent DEA Window Analysis is applied using a reference time of one year, and portfolio returns are compared with the market portfolio for each period. It is found that the financial data are a significant indicator of the future performance of a stock and a DEA-based portfolio strategy outperforms market return.",1,test,263
155133213,"Several empirical studies have found that extended household units do not appear to be highly altruistically linked, thereby violating the very premise of the Ricardian Equivalence Hypothesis (REH). This finding has a very strong implication for the effectiveness of fiscal policies that change the allocation of resources between generations. We build a two-sided altruistic-linkage model in which private transfers are made in the presence of two types of shocks: an “observable” shock that is public information (for example, a public redistribution like debt or pay-as-you-go social security) and an “unobservable” shock that is private information (for example, individual wage innovations). Parents and children observe each other’s total income but not each other’s effort level. In the second-best solution, unobservable shocks are only partially shared, whereas, for any utility function satisfying a condition derived herein, observable shocks are fully shared. The model, therefore, can generate the low degree of risk sharing found in previous empirical studies, but REH still holds.",0,test,159

157332732,"Business executives, accountants, lawyers, and the general public have shown great interest in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (""the Act"") that was passed by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2002. Designed as securities legislation, the Act reaches into areas of lawyer conduct, and the regulation of that lawyer conduct, that previously were the domain primarily of state supreme courts. Lawyers, law firms, and bar organizations have recognized that the concept of what it means to be an ethical lawyer has been altered by the Act. Related developments spawned by the Act's passage will continue to change the ethical landscape for many lawyers, even those who do not practice securities law.This article offers an overview of this important area by asking and briefly answering three questions.

43566017,"This article examines the causes of stability and change in vote intentions during the 2014 Belgian federal election campaign. Drawing on data from the 2014 Parti Rep Belgian Voter Survey, our study aims to explain why a large number of voters have switched their vote intention in the weeks preceding the federal elections. To this end, we test a series of hypotheses drawn from different theories often referred to in the literature to account for campaign volatility. The results of our analysis reveal that voters can decide to change their vote preferences during the campaign due to strategic considerations related to their perceptions of the coalition potentials of parties. We also find that voters with a low level of political interest are more likely than highly interested voters to switch from one party to another in the weeks preceding the electoral contest. Unsurprisingly, a high degree of affection for the favourite party proves to be a barrier against campaign volatility. The higher the level of affect directed to the most preferred party, the more stable will be the vote intention. Moreover, results show that citizens with a low level of external political efficacy are more prone than others to switch parties in the last weeks of the campaign. By contrast, the ideological profile of the voter has no significant impact on campaign volatility.",1,test,223
154846430,"This paper considers an overlapping generations model of economic growth populated by two types of individuals. Competitive types compare future consumption (i.e. wealth) with the mean. Self-sufficient types derive utility simply from their own consumption and do not compare themselves with others. I derive a condition under which the utility (happiness) of both types increases when the economy is populated by a larger share of competitive types. In the long-run the condition is always fulfilled when the economy is capable of economic growth. The reason for this phenomenon is that competitive types generate higher savings and thus higher aggregate capital stock and income per capita, which raises utility of both types. I show that the result is robust to the consideration of endogenous work effort and that a sufficiently high share of competitive types in a society can be inevitable for long-run economic growth to exist.",0,test,146
150929178,"Illicit drug use, for many years part of the social agenda of many countries, is now firmly on the political agenda as never before (Plant and Plant, 1999). This has resulted from the significant rise in the levels of drug use and the problems associated with this behaviour. Illicit drug use among young people has risen steadily over the past 30 years in the UK and beyond (Miller and Plant, 2001). Illegal drugs now account for 8 per cent of global trade and represents the third largest industry in the world after oil and arms. Young (2002) estimates the illicit drug trade has an annual turnover of 100 billion dollars, making it the world’s largest rogue industry against which few effective levers or sanctions exist. ::: ::: Trends in illicit drug use have changed in recent years as the number of people using drugs rose steadily throughout the twentieth century particularly amongst young people in the last two decades (Measham et al, 1998; Hibbell et al, 1997). The literature has traditionally focused upon the cause of drug use behaviour from the perspective of the individual, examining factors such as: family life, school life, friendship networks and the areas in which they live. This paper looks beyond these individual factors through an examination of the value of the social exclusion discourse which offers a more holistic approach to our understanding of adolescent drug use behaviours. Such an approach provides the opportunity to understand adolescent drug use from a perspective that presents a more all-encompassing view of the lives of drug-using young people. In doing so, it also provides insights for the design and development of drug prevention programmes.",1,test,277

The question will be asked around why the Suri, a small agro-pastoral people at the margins of state power centres, failed to develop solutions to growing problems of group conflict, challenges of state policy, the spread of small arms (since the late 1980s), and the lack of forming new local alliances with neighbouring groups. Social and cultural effects of violence are fragmenting Suri society and their regional position is weakened, in contrast to, for instance, the Nyangatom or Anywaa, neighbouring ethnic groups of comparable size, but who are more successful in the ethno-federal political structure of post-1991 Ethiopia. In addition, while the Suri are affected by new globalizing influences like tourism and evangelical Christianity, there is only a very slow movement towards, respectiv...",0,test,152
142541045,"""More than just a fascinating description of newsmaking and practice in an Indian city, this book has implications for theories of news and communication that make it a timely and significant contribution to the literature on journalism and newsmaking in the changing global environment."" * Mark Allen Peterson, Miami University At the turn of the millennium, Indian journalism has undergone significant changes. The rapid commercialization of the press, together with an increase in literacy and political consciousness, has led to swift growth in the newspaper market but also changed the way news makers mediate politics. Positioned at a historical junction where India is clearly feeling the effects of market liberalization, this study demonstrates how journalists and informants interactively create new forms of political action and consciousness. The book explores English and Hindi newsmaking and investigates the creation of news relations during the production process and how they affect political images and leadership traditions. It moves beyond the news-room to outline the role of journalists in urban society, the social lives of news texts and the way citizens bring their ideas and desires to bear on the news discourse. This important volume contributes to an emerging debate about the impact of the media on Indian society. Furthermore, it convincingly demonstrates the inseparable link between media related practices and dynamic cultural repertoires.

Its importance appears especially when it is manifested as a theoretical approach, as an analytical category and as a new practice of economic and political organisation in the regional level and in the same way in the international aspect as well. Although studiers concede that the world is going towards larger units of integration in global level, however, regionalisation (neo- regionalisation) is becoming a new identity for people in the 21 st century. This is valid especially for the European societies and states aiming to be part of the supranational structures of the European Union. In relation to this, the study below is focused on new integrating practices in Europe, which is known as “Neo-regionalism” in order to see how this new practice is influencing in intensifying the regional cooperation. To make the study even more concrete, a concentration in case study has been made in regional cooperation within CEFTA with a particular focus in its implications towards Kosovo and vice versa. The theses will also be discussed whether Kosovo has benefited or lost from this cooperation to review the possibilities of continuing further cooperation or to quit it.

Historically, social policy has responded to corporations that kill primarily through regulation and tort liability. I ask whether corporate law and governance might also address these issues.

13286123,"The aim of this research is to propose a model that relates information technology (IT) investments, supply chain governance (SCG) and performance together. For this purpose, a pilot study involving both a qualitative and a quantitative stage was conducted. The qualitative analysis, consisting of an extensive literature review and two case studies conducted in six major, globally-relevant Brazilian companies, led to the development of an initial model. This model was refined during the quantitative stage that involved 38 executives from large national companies. IT was found to be one of the main drivers of SCG influencing companies' supply chain performance. The final model consists of 5 constructs and 26 elements. Regarding the SCG constructs: (a) a new element 'formal contracts', emerged in the 'contractual SCG' construct; (b) the element 'cooperation' was not confirmed in the 'relational SCG' construct; (c) the element 'transparency' was considered an important element in the 'transactional SCG' construct. Five new elements emerged in the 'IT investment' construct. Market aspects were highlighted as being relevant in the 'supply chain performance' construct. Thus, the model includes elements that can be analyzed in order to shed light on how IT investments influence SCG and supply chain performance.",1,test,198

Human pregnancy places exceptional energetic, physical, and immunological demands on the mother to accommodate the needs of the fetus, making the woman more vulnerable during this time-period.

40443198,"Although the adoption of renewable energy is perceived as a means to enable delivery of emission-free solutions, its penetration into the energy market has not been timely and significant enough to make a material impact on the structure of the global energy system. Using backcasting as a policy tool for developing a view of a sustainable energy future, this Chapter aims to explore some of the critical hurdles as the policy makers continue to formulate and advance environmentally friendly energy consumption in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change. We illustrate the nature of the challenges to reach a wider adoption of alternative energy resources and build on the need for renewal of the energy “delivery” infrastructure through the “smart grid” as a means for transition to a sustainable economy in the longer term. While there is now engagement with the public about a sustainable future, alignment of stakeholders’ economic interests and absorption capacity of emerging technologies remain as the two main challenges in mitigating the underlying systemic hurdles to be overcome. As the public at large realize the need for a future of sustainable energy despite lack of a global consensus about definitive targets, the policy makers may seek to provide a combination of approaches that build on optimal investment incentives in the near-term, liberalization of the electricity grids in the medium term and a dynamic policy framework that induce continuous technological innovation in the longer term. Observing the current responses to the externalities by the policymakers in a number of jurisdictions we articulate such forthcoming initiatives to mitigate the systemic hurdles embedded in the existing energy infrastructure.

The lifestyle characteristics and preferences of single office workers were investigated via a questionnaire survey. Through SPSS statistical software, the preference factors of single office workers of different groups regarding different healing products were analyzed, and the lifestyle characteristics and preferences of each group were subsequently obtained. The results show that the lifestyle of single office workers could be divided into three groups. On the whole, single office workers considered healing products to be interesting and impressive with attractive and charming appearances, as well as offer the function of transforming negative emotions.

From a technical perspective, we want to be able to ensure the protection of agent state, the viability of agent communities, and the reliability of the resources on which they depend. To accomplish this, we must guarantee insofar as possible that the autonomy of agents can always be bounded by explicit enforceable policy that can be continually adjusted to maximize their effectiveness and safety in both human and computational environments. From a social perspective, we want agents to be designed so as to fit well with how people actually work together. Explicit policies governing human-agent interaction based on careful observation of work practice and an understanding of current social science research can help assure that effective and natural coordination, appropriate levels and modalities of feedback, and adequate predictability and responsiveness to human control are maintained.

156296326,"Following the beginning of the financial crises in 2008, the Federal Reserve introduced a number of new monetary policy tools. It was aimed at supporting the functioning of financial markets during the crisis and helping the economy recover from the recession by altering both the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. These new policy tools came as a last resort when traditional policy tool, such as, the federal funds rate target was already constrained near zero. This new policy tool – called “quantitative easing” – is comprised of (a) lending to financial institutions, (b) providing liquidity to key markets, and (c) purchasing longer-term securities. While the first two were aimed at lowering the short-term lending rates, the third one was aimed at lowering the long-term lending rates. Lowering of the lending rates was expected to raise consumer and business spending and, thereby, stimulate the economy. There have been studies on the effect of this new policy tool on various aspects of domestic and international economies. However, none has evaluated the policy’s effect on U.S. balance of trade. Our study develops a model of the balance of trade, which is a function of domestic (U.S.) and foreign real GDPs, exchange rate of U.S. dollar, and monetary policy (credit easing) dummy. We then empirically test the model on a panel data for the U.S. and BRICS countries over the period, 1995 – 2014, and find that the Fed’s quantitative easing has no effect, whatsoever, on U.S. balance of trade. This finding although seems counterintuitive but is logical. This is because, the BRICS countries’ economic growth is mainly export driven. Therefore, a rise (fall) in their GDP means a rise (fall) in their exports, that is a rise (fall) in U.S. imports from these countries causing a fall (rise) in U.S. balance of trade. This negative effect of BRICS countries’ real GDP on U.S. balance of trade was offset by the positive effect of lowered value of the U.S. dollar – caused by the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing – leaving the U.S. balance of trade unaffected.",0,test,346
54829922,"With the evolution of globalization, multinational companies face increasing competition on national and international markets. As a result, they seek to implement proper strategies to maximize capacity and competitiveness. This article asks whether a multinational company in medical devices has the strategic potential to transform its procurement strategy to embrace a local sourcing concept to gain competitiveness while retaining engineering origin. Study results from the medical-device industry show that attributes delivered by German origin can improve competitiveness. A significant majority of customers see the importance in the “Made in Germany” label. Customers also tend to accept the conception of local production that retains German engineering. The medical-device industry represents several branches in areas such as quality and technology. The results of this paper address product marketing, product strategy, and decision-makers dealing with sourcing alternatives. The results suggest that the strategy of pairing local production with German engineering is desirable to enhance competitiveness.",1,test,152

The ability of Methylobacterium species to form biofilms and to develop resistance to high temperatures, drying, and disinfecting agents may explain the colonization of Methylobacterium in the hospital environment in, e.g., endoscopes. Due to its slow growth, it can be easily missed during microbiological surveillance of endoscope reprocessing. The purpose of this minireview is to present an overview of documented infections and cross-contaminations with Methylobacterium related to endoscopic procedures and to illustrate the health care-associated relevance of this slow-growing bacterium.",1,test,95

153751451,"Abstract Successful implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems has become a critical facilitator for efficient operations management in both developed and developing economies. The study presented in this paper uses a novel “Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces” (CCF) model developed in the context of global new product development projects, to examine the way that the interaction of factors relevant to project management contributes to successful ERP implementation processes. Based on regression analysis of responses from 244 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms in Taiwan and China collected in May 2006, we find that the balance of centrifugal and centripetal forces fosters ERP project success, a result which has significant impacts on ERP project management practice. The study also opens up a new direction for future research on ERP implementation processes in that it suggests a novel way to model the interaction of project management factors. In addition, the new measures regarding project success and project management developed and validated in this study should prove to be useful for researchers studying ERP implementation processes.",0,test,172
54653258,"Design law has gained increased topicality since the implementation of the Directive on the legal protection of designs (the ""Directive"") in the law of the Member States, and the enactment of the Regulation on Community designs (the ""Regulation""). The Regulation introduced, in addition to the Community registered design right (""CRDR""), a Community unregistered design right (""CUDR"") which is very similar to the CRDR. The CUDR came into force on 6 March 2002. It is in part based on the British invention of the unregistered design right or design right (""UDR""). Before the introduction of the CUDR, this type of right did not exist anywhere else in Europe. While the registered design right (""RDR"") existed in Great Britain since the 18th century, the British legislature only introduced UDR in 1988 while reforming the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (""CDPA""); the UDR entered into force on 1 August 1989. Thus, it is a relatively new right compared to traditional intellectual property rights. Is the British UDR remote from the new CUDR as introduced by the Community lawmaker? The object of this article is to compare the main features of the UDR and the CUDR, in particular focusing on the requirements for protection and infringement, in order to evaluate whether or not the UDR will survive the CUDR, or whether the new CUDR will erase the UDR from the legal landscape, and whether UDR case law will influence future Community design courts case law. Comparisons with copyright will also be made where relevant. Finally, the article raises a further question: how to accommodate the relationships between all coexistent intellectual property rights, national and Community rights on the one hand, and traditional and new rights on the other.",0,test,284
59490879,"The study of institutional change over a period of history involves several theoretical and methodological issues. In proposing a commentary on our article published in Vol. 17 n°3 of M@n@gement (Peton and Peze, 2014), Daudigeos, Boutinot and Jaumier have provided an opportunity to open up the debate, and we thank them for that. Their commentary concerns two major points: a methodological question concerning the choice of data in a historical research context, and a resulting reflection on the consideration given to collective representations in analysis of institutional work. Before replying in concrete terms to the points raised by Daudigeos et al., we wish to return to the objective of our article and clear up one matter they raise. Our study starts with reflection on the different institutional pillars. While Scott (2008) stresses the importance of all three pillars (normative, cognitive and regulative), the regulative pillar is rarely studied in the literature on change. It finds itself relegated to the role of a ratifier of changes driven by the cognitive and normative pillars, and has generally been considered static and treated as the same thing as the rule produced by the State (Scott, 2008; McCann, 1994). The case of Faute Inexcusable, an institutionalized practice introduced in 1898 and still in force today, reveals the complexity of a regulative pillar that has a real, and very specific, institutional dynamic. We can only agree with Daudigeos et al. when they stress the importance of paying attention to interaction between institutional pillars in institutional change. Our article focused mainly on the regulative pillar, such that we do not propose any contribution regarding interactions between pillars and their mutual effects – that was not our research project. However, our contribution to the understanding – and a form of intellectual rehabilitation – of the regulative pillar paves the way for a broader research agenda explicitly aimed at exploring the interaction dynamic between the pillars, without claiming to answer it comprehensively.",0,test,324
4814796,"PURPOSE ::: In this study, the impact of contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scan interpretations by emergency medicine team on patients' morbidity and mortality was evaluated and their interpretations were compared to radiologists' reports. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: During a 3-month period, all patients who had undergone a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scan at the emergency department enrolled in this study. All CT scans were interpreted blindly by the emergency medicine (ED) attending physicians and the patients were treated accordingly. Radiologists reported all the CT scans within 12 h. Radiologists' reports were put into the agreement or disagreement group retrospectively. A panel of experts further evaluated the disagreement groups' medical charts and placed them in clinically significant or insignificant group based on the follow-up for 28 days. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In this study, 170 CT scans were interpreted. The agreement rate was 68.2%. In the clinically significant disagreement group, eight patients did not receive the required treatment and three patients were over treated. Although the overall mortality rate was 5, none could have been prevented by a prompt radiologist's report. The disagreement group had longer hospital stay (p = 0.006) and transfer to other wards (p = 0.035). The inter-rater reliability between emergency medicine attending physicians and attending radiologists was substantial (kappa = 0.77) and statistically significant (p < 0.0001). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our findings support the cautious use of ED physicians' CT scan interpretations for patients' management. Ideally, the ED physicians should utilize a real-time radiologist interpretation in critical patients. This collaboration will result in better patient management.",1,test,261

However, the IBS subgroup with alternating bowel habits (IBS-A) has been poorly characterized. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVES ::: (i) To determine a set of bowel habit symptom criteria, which most specifically identifies IBS patients with an alternating bowel habit, (ii) to describe IBS-A bowel symptom patterns, and (iii) to compare clinical characteristics among IBS-A, constipation-predominant (IBS-C), and diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: One thousand one hundred and two Rome I positive IBS patients were analyzed. Three sets of potential criteria for IBS-A were developed and compared by multirater Kappa test. Gastrointestinal, psychological, extraintestinal symptoms, and health-related quality of life were compared in IBS-A, IBS-C, and IBS-D using chi(2) test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Stool consistency was determined to be the most specific criteria for alternating bowel habits. IBS-A patients reported rapid fluctuations in bowel habits with short symptom flares and remissions. There was a greater prevalence of psychological and extraintestinal symptoms in the IBS-A subgroup compared to IBS-C and IBS-D. No differences were seen between bowel habit subtypes in health-related quality of life. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: IBS-A patients have rapidly fluctuating symptoms and increased psychological comorbidity, which should be taken into account for clinical practice and clinical trials.",0,test,231

8824642,"The anaerobic digestion process comprises a whole network of sequential and parallel reactions, of both biochemical and physicochemical nature. Mathematical models, aiming at understanding and optimization of the anaerobic digestion process, describe these reactions in a structured way, the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) being the most well established example. While these models distinguish between different microorganisms involved in different reactions, to our knowledge they all neglect species diversity between organisms with the same function, i.e. performing the same reaction. Nevertheless, available experimental evidence suggests that the structure and properties of a microbial community may be influenced by process operation and on their turn also determine the reactor functioning. In order to adequately describe these phenomena, mathematical models need to consider the underlying microbial diversity. This is demonstrated in this contribution by extending the ADM1 to describe microbial diversity between organisms of the same functional group. The resulting model has been compared with the traditional ADM1 in describing experimental data of a pilot-scale hybrid Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Filter Bed (UASFB) reactor, as well as in a more detailed simulation study. The presented model is further shown useful in assessing the relationship between reactor performance and microbial community structure in mesophilic CSTRs seeded with slaughterhouse wastewater when facing increasing levels of ammonia.",1,test,213

23140030,"Now that the sequencing of the human genome has been completed, the basic challenges are finding the genes, locating their coding regions and predicting their functions. This will result in a new understanding of human biology as well as in the design of new molecular structures as potential novel diagnostic or drug discovery targets. The assessment of gene function may be performed using the tools of the genome program. These tools represent high-throughput methods used to evaluate changes in the expression of many or all genes of an organism at the same time in order to investigate genetic pathways for normal development and disease. This will lead to a shift in the scientific paradigm: In the pre-proteomics era, functional assignments were derived from hypothesis-driven experiments designed to understand specific cellular processes. The new tools describe proteins on a proteome-wide scale, thereby creating a new way of doing cell research which results in the determination of three-dimensional protein structures and the description of protein networks. These descriptions may then be used for the design of new hypotheses and experiments in the traditional physiological, biochemical and pharmacological sense. The evaluation of genetically manipulated animals or newly designed biomolecules will require a thorough understanding of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology and the experimental approaches will involve many new technologies, including in vivo imaging with single-photon emission tomography and positron emission tomography. Nuclear medicine procedures may be applied for the determination of gene function and regulation using established and new tracers or using in vivo reporter genes such as enzymes, receptors, antigens or transporters. Pharmacogenomics will identify new surrogate markers for therapy monitoring which may represent potential new tracers for imaging.

59436766,"Changes in the competitive environment, largely spurred by restrictions in government funding and an increase of educational service providers in the market, have forced higher education instructions to become more proactive in terms of student recruitment. In response, many institutions have turned to corporate principles to run their operation and to recruit their ‘customers’ (that is, the students themselves). This exploratory study serves to ascertain whether using a relationship marketing approach is conducive to the task of identifying, selecting and recruiting highly desirable students. In this respect, particular emphasis is placed on whether these individuals are actually interested in establishing a pre-application relationship with a selected number of institutions, as well as the benefits they hope to accrue from such relationships. A hypothesized framework is thereafter appended as a guide for initiating and developing relationships with prospective students. Key variables influencing the decision process were probed. The reputation of the institution was found to be the most important factor in a scholar’s decision of a place of further study, followed by geographic location and thereafter campus safety. However, these differed between ethnic groups. Scholars’ receptiveness to the prospect of entering into a pre-application relationship with a tertiary education institution was found to be favourable. A mere eight percent of respondents claimed that they didn’t wish to have a relationship with an institution prior to the applications period. The remainder wished to be associated with one or more institutions. It was concluded that on average, the more serious scholar is interested in relationships with two institutions. In this regard, the factors attracting scholars to such relationships were identified. The availability of financial aid was found to be the most prominent factor, followed by curriculum advice and reduced application fees.

199309013,"In Australia, successive governments have sought to extinguish 'native title', preferring English feudal socage, but not the Australian Indigenous systems of land title. Australian governments want courts, constituted overwhelmingly by non-indigenous lawyers, to decide land disputes as for feudal socage. Therefore, this article suggests a need to understand this attempted radical reframing of Australian Indigenous titles to land, through the convenient lens of Goffman's frame analysis. The research question is whether Anglo-Australian frame transformation of the Indigenous land titles into mere religion, song and art, extinguishes land title. The article tries to show that Australian indigenous land title is communal allodial title, as a bundle of subsisting rights by operation of Australian Continental Common Law, which therefore cannot be extinguished by the fraud inherent in frame transformation. Indigenous land title is true communal allodial title, beset by a fraudulent colonial occupation, suggesting a lack of internal reason in colonial policy and administration. Successive governments have tried to frame transform the highly sophisticated and ancient indigenous legal and social system, including sophisticated celestial mapping and navigation systems, into mere religious art. This frame transformation is reversible by epideictic rhetoric. The Indigenous system is transmitted phylogenetically, in which governance government officials can have no participation.

It is emphasized that liability has an advantage over taxation: inefficiency of incentives arises under taxation when, as would be typical, it would be impractical for a tax to reflect all variables that significantly affect expected harm, whereas efficiency of incentives under liability does not require the state to determine expected harm - it requires only that injurers pay for harm that occurs. However, taxation enjoys an advantage over liability: incentives under liability are diluted to the degree that injurers might escape suit. The optimal joint use of taxation and liability is also examined, and it is shown in the model that is analyzed that liability should be employed fully because liability creates more efficient incentives than taxation; a tax should be used only to take up the slack due to the possibility that suit for harm would not be brought.",1,test,153

Driven by a real data set, we propose three trivariate Sarmanov distributions with generalized linear models (GLMs) for marginals and incorporate various individual characteristics of the policyholders by means of explanatory variables. Since the data set was collected over a longer time period (10 years), we also added each individual’s exposure to risk. To estimate the parameters of the three Sarmanov distributions, we analyze a pseudo-maximumlikelihood method. Finally, the three models are compared numerically with the simpler trivariate Negative Binomial GLM.",1,test,114

156588674,"This article studies the behavior of Mexico’s Federal Supreme Court (Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nacion) (SCJN) regarding human rights during its Ninth Epoch (1995-2011). According to the empirical data obtained, after a twelve-year period (1995-2006) of inactivity in this area, the SCJN recently (2007-11) has begun to gradually take action. The change is evident in three aspects: a) the increased use and reinterpretation of its powers in Amparo proceedings; b) the increased use, interpretation and regulation of Powers of Investigation for serious violations of individual guarantees (abrogated in 2011), and; c) the inclusion of deliberative elements in preparing proceedings on grounds of unconstitutionality (Accion de Inconstitucionalidad). The change in the SCJN’s behavior towards human rights since 2007 is explained by the institutional independence it has gained in the fragmented political system in assuming the role of arbitrator in important conflicts between political actors. The SCJN has also developed strategies that legitimate its greater involvement in protecting human rights before the political system and society. In general, the political system under which the Court acts has not reacted to provoke a reversal of this tendency in favor of human rights. In the 16-year period studied here, the incremental change in the SCJN’s behavior is observed along with its evolution from a weak court with marginal participation into a court that has won its independence before political power and is currently looking for greater participation in protecting human rights.",0,test,239

154039004,"Headline CPI, core CPI and indices for various expenditure categories were analyzed. Long-term linear trends have been found in the difference between the core CPI and the headline CPI in the USA. Duration of these periods is different for positive (18 years) and negative (8 years) trends, and the trends change to opposite during some shorter time intervals of 2 to 4 years. The difference between the core CPI and the index for energy is similar to that between the core CPI and headline CPI. The index for energy will reach the core CPI in 2008, however. Then, one should not expect further increase in energy price beyond that dictated by the CPI. It is likely that oil price will be falling in absolute terms. The difference between the core CPI and the index for food also has two linear branches after 1980, but the slope of the current trend is weak and the difference will intercept zero line only in 2014. The difference between the core CPI and the housing index is characterized by an almost constant duration of negative and positive branches i?½ approximately 11 years. The current period of negative slope in the difference will approach its turning point in 2008 or 2009 and is characterized by very high volatility. The next trend has to be positive, i.e. the housing index will be growing at a lower rate than the headlining CPI. The difference for the transportation index had a longer period of positive slope i?½ between 1980 and 2004. During this period the difference reached the level of 30 units of index.

48554130,"Abstract A common strategy for controlling spending is to impose a price restraint on oneself. For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situa...",0,test,149

No bias in interpretation is observed when the masked prime is a word that is semantically related to the target with no morphological relationship (e.g., glue), though such a semantically based bias is revealed when the prime is unmasked. Because the masked priming results cannot be explained in terms of facilitation of processing at either the form level or the semantic level, it is concluded that an intermediate level provides the locus of the effect, referred to here as the ‘lemma’ level. Thus, any model of lexical processing needs to incorporate such an intermediate level to capture the relationship between stem morphemes and their derived forms.",0,test,136
1478836,"There is a long-standing controversy over the question of whether targeting social transfers towards the bottom part of the income distribution actually enhances or weakens their redistributive impact. Korpi and Palme have influentially claimed that ""the more we target benefits at the poor, the less likely we are to reduce poverty and inequality"". The basic empirical underpinning of this claim is a strong inverse relationship at the country level between social transfer targeting and redistributive impact. We show that this no longer holds as a robust empirical generalisation. The relationship between the extent of targeting and redistributive impact over a broad set of empirical specifications, country selections and data sources has in fact become a very weak one. For what it matters, targeting tends to be associated with higher levels of redistribution, especially when overall effort in terms of spending is high. We try to make substantive sense of this breakdown of the originally established relationship by focusing on two questions: first, what has changed in the countries originally included in the study and, second, what is different about the countries now additionally included in the analysis?",0,test,187

150907852,"Abstract : It is a well established axiom that attempting to defeat an insurgency or a terrorist organization head-on is merely treating the symptoms of a problem. For long-term success, the campaign must also address the root causes of the insecurity that spawned conflict in the first place. In this monograph, British academic and practitioner Dr. Shima Keene describes a number of ways in which financial intelligence can be leveraged not only to disrupt adversary activities, but also to provide indicators and warnings of future actions and, ultimately, to address underlying insecurities. Dr. Keene was previously both a banker and a British Army reservist. In this monograph, she uses her expertise as a threat finance specialist to outline specific areas where financial intelligence analysis techniques, which are common in the private sector, can be applied to combating insurgency, terrorism, and other hard security threats. Dr. Keene argues that financial disruption techniques used in counterinsurgency have been poorly coordinated and at times counterproductive, and cites the targeting of the Hawala money transfer system as a specific example. Instead, she notes intelligence derived from analysis of financial data can provide much greater value in both understanding and predicting the adversary s activities, as well as providing for precise targeting to disrupt them. The Strategic Studies Institute recommends this monograph not only to counterinsurgency and counterterrorism practitioners and policymakers, but also to the Intelligence community more widely; all of these will find its conclusions on the handling of financial data and the value of threat finance analysis valuable.",0,test,255

We address here two main questions: (1) How do we solve the issue of the subjectivity in the evaluation of data and results, which may be particularly critical for read-across, but may have a role also for the QSAR assessment? (2) How do we take advantage of the results of both approaches to support each other? The QSAR model starts from the training set. The presence of similar chemicals with property values close to that predicted can support the result. The approach in read-across is the opposite. The assessment is focused on the few substances similar to the target. The data quality of the similar chemicals is fundamental. A risk is poor standardization in the definition of 'similarity', because different approaches may be applied. Inspired by the principles of high transparency and reproducibility, a new program for read-across, called ToxRead, has been developed and made freely available ( www.toxgate.eu ).

53579830,"During the 1960s, different critical voices emerged with regard to the main gaps of technocratic planning (what Jacobs calls ‘modern, orthodox city planning’), voices highlighting the oversimplifying epistemological approaches that had been characterising planning in the first half of the twentieth century. Jane Jacobs’ thought has been of paramount importance in influencing planning and urban discourses worldwide, but she has not been isolated: in the same years, other critical voices have been shaping a critical thought and fostering debate, on both sides of the Atlantic. Among them, Paul Davidoff, appealing for advocacy planning in NYC, Giancarlo De Carlo, proposing a sharp critique of architectural and planning education in Italy and Reyner Banham and his group, advocating the (paradoxical) possibility of non-planning in the UK. This article proposes to identify a relevant common feature across their positions in the connection between epistemological and political critique; as Jane Jacobs, many critics of traditional technocratic planning underline the inappropriate and ineffective mechanisms of knowledge production and use in urban planning: if cities are characterised by organised complexity (‘intricate social and economic order under the seeming disorder of cities’, as Jacobs puts it), then it is not possible to reduce them to ‘simple problems’.

6551269,"Herpes Simplex keratitis (HSK), caused by Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1), is the leading cause of infectious corneal blindness in the western world [1]. Initial infection develops through ocular surface entry from droplet spread [2]. Once HSV-1 has breached the epithelial barrier of the ocular surface, it is recognized by Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), which then activate the appropriate innate immune response. Despite the high prevalence of HSV-1, only a small minority of patients develop ocular manifestations. Therefore, we hypothesized that TLR expression and activity may be deregulated in patients with HSK, which would reflect in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses observed in these patients. We investigated the effects of the TLR ligands 3, 4, 7 and 9 (as they are involved in anti-viral immune defence [3]) on cytokine induction from a patient with active HSK and compared responses of this patient to TLR ligands on a subsequent follow up visit where disease was diagnosed to be inactive.",0,test,159

This paper presents a new approach to quantify residential demand responsiveness to (time-of-use) TOU rates, which does not entail an econometric estimation of TOU demand equations. Based on one of the four smart grid pilots in China, our approach uses the survey data collected in 2011 from 236 residents in Yinchuan to implement a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the minimum, expected and maximum demand responsiveness to four TOU rate designs. We find that residents do not respond to TOU pricing when the TOU rate design only causes a 10% increase in their existing electricity bills under non-TOU rates. However, their estimated peak demand responsiveness is 8.41% (21.26%) when the peak-time price increases by 20% (40%). Based on these findings, we conclude that suitably designed TOU rates are useful to the efficient operation of a smart grid.",0,test,155

A significant number of youth will receive a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating condition that without treatment will contribute to contemporaneous and long-term negative health consequences. Psychotherapy often has been advocated as the first line in PTSD treatments, and existing interventions have been primarily based on treating individual symptoms. Nevertheless, the deleterious effects of PTSD reverberate beyond the youth; parents, caregivers, and other social influences (e.g., romantic partners) report high levels of distress due the youth’s struggles with their symptoms or due to their own feelings of guilt, shame, or helplessness. Recognizing that social agents are a significant factor in both PTSD recovery, reduction in problematic behaviors, and caregiver stress, there is a surge of PTSD treatments that have been modified to include, either directly or indirectly, social agents. Although still in the beginning stages of development, these treatments hold much promise in treating PTSD and secondary symptoms of the child and reducing distress in others.",0,test,174

12830522,"How does the public reckon which risks to be concerned about? The availability heuristic and the affect heuristic are key accounts of how laypeople judge risks. Yet, these two accounts have never been systematically tested against each other, nor have their predictive powers been examined across different measures of the public’s risk perception. In two studies, we gauged risk perception in student samples by employing three measures (frequency, value of a statistical life, and perceived risk) and by using a homogeneous (cancer) and a classic set of heterogeneous causes of death. Based on these judgments of risk, we tested precise models of the availability heuristic and the affect heuristic and different definitions of availability and affect. Overall, availability-by-recall, a heuristic that exploits people’s direct experience of occurrences of risks in their social network, conformed to people’s responses best. We also found direct experience to carry a high degree of ecological validity (and one that clearly surpasses that of affective information). However, the relative impact of affective information (as compared to availability) proved more pronounced in value-of-a-statistical-life and perceived-risk judgments than in riskfrequency judgments. Encounters with risks in the media, in contrast, played a negligible role in people’s judgments. Going beyond the assumption of exclusive reliance on either availability or affect, we also found evidence for mechanisms that combine both, either sequentially or in a composite fashion. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications of our results, including how to foster people’s risk calibration and the success of education campaigns.",0,test,250

This paper examines whether managers strategically use financial policy when facing the risk of one such liability – litigation claims. I find that greater litigation exposure leads firms to choose higher leverage. I show that this leverage increase is brought on by an active decision to repurchase shares. These repurchases appear to be financed with a combination of excess cash and short term debt as they coincide with a significant decrease in cash holdings and an increase in short term liabilities. These firms also increase their use of operating leases, which, due to their priority in bankruptcy, have similar characteristics to secured debt. Finally, the effects seem to be stronger for firms with a higher probability of bankruptcy. These results run counter to anecdotal suggestions that firms may adjust financial policy to build a war chest in anticipation of litigation and they suggest that firms use capital structure strategically to increase shareholder value.",0,test,174

Sequencing and characterisation of fliC was performed in the development of a molecular serotyping technique.ResultsFliC sequencing of 106 strains revealed two groups; the g-complex included those exhibiting ""g"" or ""m,t"" antigenic factors, and the non-g strains which formed a second more diverse group. Variation in fliC was characterised and sero-specific motifs identified. Furthermore, it was possible to identify differences in certain H antigens that are not detected by traditional serotyping. A rapid short sequencing assay was developed to target serotype-specific sequence motifs in fliC. The assay was evaluated for identification of H1 antigens with a panel of 55 strains.ConclusionFliC sequences were obtained for more than 100 strains comprising 29 different H1 alleles. Unique pyrosequencing profiles corresponding to the H1 component of the serotype were generated reproducibly for the 23 alleles represented in the evaluation panel. Short read sequence assays can now be used to identify fliC alleles in approximately 97% of the 50 medically most important Salmonella in England and Wales. Capability for high throughput testing and automation give these assays considerable advantages over traditional methods.",0,test,219

157511094,"The time is ripe for a reappraisal of the separation of powers. The two-dimensional landscape famously described in Justice Robert H. Jackson’s concurring opinion in Youngstown has dominated discourse about the interaction of the three federal branches. Charting presidential conduct on the vertical axis of a map whose horizontal axis measures Congress’s position ranging from approval to disapproval gave Justice Jackson an elegantly simple and memorable way to classify presidential actions from the most strongly defensible to the most constitutionally vulnerable.The resulting classification scheme became a convenient triptych describing the geography of a “flatland” constitutional universe — one constructed in a two-dimensional space, carved into three simple zones. Missing from that triptych has been an analytical guide for navigating a multidimensional universe of relevant constitutional values and relationships. This Essay proposes an approach to developing such a guide: by considering two additional dimensions relevant to the separation of powers — respect for federalism and concern for individual rights — courts can better discern the lawful shape of presidential power.",0,test,169
55578592,"Recent decades have witnessed a remarkable rise in academic research and political discussion on borders and border regions. In broad terms, we can distinguish at least two major traditions which have developed more or less in parallel directions and in increasing interaction with one another. There is the older American tradition of “borderlands studies” that has gained new ground and forms today an established academic institution around the scholarly organization Association of Borderlands Studies (ABS) with its regular conferences and publications, most notably the Journal of Borderlands Studies (JBS). In this review I will concentrate on the more novel European based research tradition which has partly gained inspiration from the American scholarly discussion and partly opened new research directions, with certain influence on the broader international research community. This tradition is perhaps best known through the series of Border Regions in Transition (BRIT) conferences and the publications linked to them. Since the first gathering in Berlin in 1994, there have been ten BRIT conferences organized in Finland, the U.S., India, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Poland, Canada and Chile. Its activities have gathered together scholars from around the world, from Europe and the Americas as well as from Asian countries. In my analysis on the recent trends in border studies I will concentrate mainly in reflecting on the publications of BRIT conferences. As in the U.S., also the European conference and publication activities have led to more challenging institutional forms. Members of the BRIT network have carried out several national and international research projects including large-scale projects of the European Union Framework program for research such as Lines of Exclusion as Arenas of Co-operation (EXLINEA) and Local Dimensions of a Wider European Neighbourhood (EUDIMENSIONS). In addition, new research units and Centres have been established both in the European Union and outside, e.g. Finland, the Netherlands, the UK, Canada, India, Israel and recently even Japan.

Moreover, one of the motivations behind using IT is that such techniques transcend the barriers of more traditional Socratic techniques. We argue that once we examine the most compelling arguments for IT (i.e., that it encourages discovery-based, constructive learning styles), it emerges as more Socratic than it would first appear. We maintain that IT has the potential to benefit pedagogy, but caution instructors to think critically about IT, and its implicit ideology, as well as their role of educator rather than trainer.",0,test,124

To test this hypothesis, a survey was conducted to determine public acceptance of the use of various forms of personal information to achieve specific governmental objectives. The data revealed that the public is, in fact, willing to accept the use of personal information to achieve certain governmental objectives; however, not without limitation. Factors that affected the level of acceptance were the achievability of the policy, sensitivity of data being used, the specific governmental objective, and trust in the branch of government utilizing the data.

155225818,"Experts from both sides of the political spectrum in the United States agree that the healthcare system is in trouble. Overall, the U.S. healthcare system costs more and achieves less, per capita, than systems in other OECD nations. Opinions vary strongly, however, on the best solution to the problem. Some argue that public provision would be best able to provide universal coverage with lower prices. Others argue that only the market could ensure efficiency. The healthcare debate in the U.S. is further complicated by lobbying activity to protect existing interests. Health insurance companies argue strongly against any form of public provision, claiming such arrangements would make them unable to compete. Doctors’ organizations, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals also maneuver to ensure that any new legislation would not hurt them. Rather than build a full-scale merit comparison between the American and other industrialized countries’ approaches to healthcare, we simply argue that the U.S. adherence to private insurance does not address the goal of efficiency either with regard to the objective of the simply understood ""economic"" cost-benefit calculation, or in terms of maintaining some normatively set level of accessible care at the lowest cost. The U.S. at present defines its goals insofar as healthcare is concerned not normatively, but via the on-going political process. Currently, the central focus in this process is on cost controls rather than the extent to which politically set standards for care are met. Attempts to create legislation in the U.S. that balances political demands with efficiency are daunting and in practice generally result in sacrificing some of the goals to satisfy pressure groups. Here we approach the issue of efficiency alone, explicitly ignoring political constraints.",0,test,277

154788600,"Major changes have been challenging journalism in the last two decades, in the context of the ‘digital age’. The technological possibilities developed in the ‘information society’, together with the social and cultural trend for more participation, opened this field to new actors, which caused professional journalists to lose their traditional monopoly of searching, gathering, editing and diffusing news in the public sphere. At the same time, these new possibilities of communicating are increasingly forcing the old actors to play new roles in the media. The digital techniques and the Internet gave birth to a big diversity of new media and of new forms of dealing with journalism and public information. ‘Citizen journalism’, ‘participatory journalism’, ‘user-generated content’, ‘crowdsourcing’, ‘weblogs’,‘ Twitter’, ‘Facebook’, etc., are words and expressions rather common these days, all of them somehow calling the attention to the fact that journalism-as-a-professional-activity seems to coexist more and more with various forms of journalismas-a-civic-activity , performed by very different people, under very different conditions and with very different levels of involvement and expertise. As a consequence, questions are being raised about the ethical implications of this new scenario, both in what regards the activity of professional journalists in new (online) media and the active commitment of ‘laypersons’ in the process of gathering, editing and diffusing information. In this paper we will try to analyze and to discuss these questions, with reference, among others, to Eliot Freidson (2004) and his distinction between ‘practice ethics’ and ‘institutional ethics’. Furthermore, we’ll try to discuss what really makes journalism distinctive from other practices that nowadays coexist with it in the public sphere, strongly increasing the possibilities of communication between people but not necessarily following the purposes of public interest and of civic democratic participation. In this context, the concept of journalism seems to ask for a clearer definition, and so do the roles to be played by journalists in the more complex (but also more stimulating) media environment we are dealing with in contemporary societies.",0,test,329

Often noted is the need for grassroots work to be carried out ‘with,’ rather than ‘on’ or ‘for,’ a community. Although this notion implies partnership, how the planner-community relationship is conceived depends largely on how the community is defined. From a community-based perspective, action is critical to the development of a community’s identity. This outlook suggests that participation determines community membership. Accordingly, conventional community limits may be transformed. The purpose of this article is to offer an understanding of how community-based planners may be viewed to be community members. The focus is the various perspectives on community and their respective implications for membership. To begin, the traditional perspective of community that is grounded in realism is presented. A community-based outlook based on participation is then provided. Subsequently recognized is the importance of dialogue, which is an underdeveloped and, at times, overlooked strategy in community-based practice.

145584266,"Legal reforms over the past generation have transformed juvenile crime regulation from a system that viewed most youth crime as the product of immaturity into one that is ready to hold many youths to the standard of accountability imposed on adults. Supporters of these reforms argue that they are simply a response to the inability of the traditional juvenile court to deal adequately with violent youth crime, but the legal changes that have transformed the system have often been undertaken in an atmosphere of moral panic, with little deliberation about consequences and costs.In this book we argue that a developmental model of regulation that is grounded in scientific knowledge about adolescence and juvenile crime is more compatible with the justice system's commitment to fairness and also more likely to promote social welfare than the contemporary approach. This premise for the most part translates into a legal regime that deals with most adolescent offenders as an intermediate legal category of persons - neither children nor adults. Developmental knowledge clarifies that the typical teenage offender is less culpable than his adult counterpart and therefore deserves less punishment. It also indicates that most adolescents mature out of their inclination to get involved in criminal activity, and that correctional interventions may influence the trajectories of their adult lives. The research shows that programs that attend to developmental knowledge are likely to facilitate the transition to conventional adult roles, benefiting both young offenders and society by reducing recidivism and reducing the economic costs of crime regulation.",0,test,251

141424722,"This paper argues that in the wake of Crawford, Davis, and Bryant, trial courts are in need of a workable definition of “ongoing emergency,” as well as a test or set of guidelines that can be applied in assessing the admissibility of statements made under such circumstances. In essence, this paper seeks to answer two important questions now confronting trial courts: (1) what is an “ongoing emergency,” and (2) what set of factors can enable a trial court to establish the existence of an ongoing emergency? Ultimately, in defining “ongoing emergency,” this paper borrows from earlier Supreme Court rulings in the Fourth Amendment context. For purposes of the Confrontation Clause, this paper defines “ongoing emergency” the same way the Court has previously defined “exigent circumstances”: a situation in which “there is an imminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that evidence will be immediately destroyed” for the purpose of hindering future prosecution, “or that a suspect will escape.” This definition is relied upon in part because it is offered, in dissent, by Justice Ginsburg, a vocal critic of the Court’s apparent retreat from Crawford. It is also relied upon, in part, because it seems to stand up to most situations in which officers might obtain statements from a declarant not solely for the purpose of preserving testimony for future prosecution. This paper also prescribes a flexible totality of the circumstances test that courts can apply in ascertaining whether the facts surrounding a declarant’s statement(s) do, in fact, constitute an emergency. This test places great emphasis on whether the facts create a situation in which the declarant’s statement bears sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant admission.",0,test,277

As nations move farther and farther away from the era of authoritarianism, we might naturally assume that the influence of those regimes would dissipate as well. The books under review here arrive on our shelves two decades or more since many of the countries of the region recovered their democratic practices. It would be convenient to say that the mere passage of time has erased painful memories of the repression, rendered militaries less politically influential, and given democratic institutions time to congeal. It would also be wrong. It turns out that memories cannot be easily erased, even less so for the families of victims who have never recovered the bodies of their loved ones or have never had their day in court. Military institutions vary in influence but remain relevant, at times interventionist, and have to be dealt with. Progress toward institutional consolidation can be found, but many democracies are still struggling, and some are in serious trouble.

In many of these instances, the technical decisions that resulted had law-like effects in the sense that they constrained or enabled the ways in which users can communicate and can access and use information over the Internet, whether or not such decisions supported or subverted legal decision-making, and whether or not legal decision-makers understood the societal implications of the technical decisions that were being made. This is one of the two ways in which technical and legal decision-making have become interpenetrated. The literature on legal engagement with problems generated by the technical features of the Internet is vast. This article appears within the nascent literature on technical engagement with legal problems. It does so in an effort to contribute to the building of a shared epistemic and decision-making space that involves both the technical and the legal communities.",0,test,221

Country-specific indexes measuring the degree of economic freedoms that exist within the market and the degree of political rights that exist within a democracy are used in a panel data analysis to explain the observed levels of various quality of life measures reflecting issues that are relevant to women. These empirical results indicate that capitalism often has a stronger beneficial impact on many aspects of women's well-being and gender equality in society.",0,test,100

However, as amounts of industrial clusters have displayed their competence, some have lost their competitive advantages in global competition. It is meaningful for clusters’ development to cultivate their sustainable competence. This paper analyzes the sources of cluster competence. According this paper, the important ways to make cluster competence sustainable include transferring and sharing knowledge, making innovation in the cluster, absorbing knowledge from other outer sources, and cultivating unique and exclusive knowledge innovation capability that is differing from other clusters. This paper advances two ways for clusters achieving the transformation from closed knowledge system to open one: firstly, cultivate the capability of absorbing new knowledge from other local knowledge sources; secondly, improve the capability of knowledge share and innovation in the cluster.",0,test,132
31384825,"Abstract The author examines how time delayed effects of economic development, education, and gender equality influence political democracy. Literature review shows inadequate understanding of lagged effects, which raises methodological and theoretical issues with the current quantitative studies of democracy. Using country-years as a unit of analysis, the author estimates a series of OLS PCSE models for each predictor with a systematic analysis of the distributions of the lagged effects. The second set of multiple OLS PCSE regressions are estimated including all three independent variables. The results show that economic development, education, and gender have three unique trajectories of the time-delayed effects: Economic development has long-term effects, education produces continuous effects regardless of the timing, and gender equality has the most prominent immediate and short term effects. The results call for the reassessment of model specifications and theoretical setups in the quantitative studies of democracy.",0,test,144

This problem is especially interesting in a time where schools are having their budgets vastly cut. The importance of education is lauded as the reason to allow marketing, along with it being used as a teaching tool, among other reasons.

153823144,"In view of the continuum of human existence, it is apparent that we are always living in between the past and the future. Yet we intuitively and perpetually make arbitrary demarcations among the past, the present, and the future. Parallel to one’s memory of one’s lived early childhood experience, our collective memory of the past — especially the remote past — can be hazy, indefinite, and surrealistic. Just as one’s present state of mind shapes one’s understanding of one’s early childhood experiences, contemporaneous ideologies can circumscribe historical inquiries into the collective past. Thus, teaching about the past is always a value-laden inquiry. As Ann Chinnery is keenly aware of the interconnections between the aims and the methods of teaching about the past, she argues that teaching about the past must foster critical historical consciousness so learners may apprehend and appreciate difficult knowledge from the past. To Chinnery, cultivating critical historical consciousness differs from “a cognitive, knowledge-based approach” to recollecting the past. More specifically, Chinnery, in line with Emmanuel Levinas and Roger Simon, acknowledges and affirms that one’s “here and now subjectivity” has always been interwoven with the past at both individual and collective levels. Drawing from her teaching experience, Chinnery further concludes that cultivating critical historical consciousness need not rely upon personal testimony. Instead, teaching and learning about the past should focus on facilitating learners’ undertaking critical contextual inquiries into the formation of subjectivity and public policies. Such critical inquiries, while disquieting, can lead to recognizing our ethical responsibilities of “receiving the past” and “shaping the future.”",0,test,257
8262758,"Participants in electricity markets face a substantial amount of uncertainty, and with increased penetration of volatile renewable generation this uncertainty has further increased. Conventionally designed electricity markets cope with uncertainty by running two markets: a market that is cleared ahead of time, followed by a real-time balancing market to reconcile actual realizations of demand and available generation. In such mechanisms, the initial clearing process does not take into account the distribution of outcomes in the balancing market. Recently, an alternative so-called stochastic settlement market has been proposed (see, e.g., Pritchard et al. 2010 [Pritchard G, Zakeri G, Philpott A (2010) A single-settlement, energy-only electric power market for unpredictable and intermittent participants.

Indeed, in most European Union (EU) countries, there has been broad consensus about integration between the main parties. Importantly, previous research shows that this elite convergence is not replicated among the voters. Using European Election Study (EES) data from the 1999 and 2004 Euroelections, this article analyses the ideological dispersion of parties on the EU dimension in the EU member states. We examine the development of inter-party competition on the EU dimension between the two elections, and then test the impact of various factors – divided into public opinion, national party system and EU hypotheses – on the breadth of party positions over integration. The strongest link exists between government size and ideological alternatives, with large coalition governments hindering party competition on the EU dimension.

115132320,"A consumption tax amounts to exempt savings from taxation. As such, it would have important distributional effects, first of all from the poor to the rich, but also towards capital intensive industries; and intergenerational, away from the very young (students) and the old. For what concerns long term effects, most studies show that a consumption tax would be moderately more efficient and much simpler than the income tax. Nevertheless with such a tax, the progressivity of the current system could not be replicated. Attempts to mitigate the regressive features of the consumption tax would unavoidably lower the efficiency gains, and significantly increase complexity. I conclude that the passage to a consumption tax has to be done on the basis of a judgement of value (how progressive should our tax system be?), and not based on technical arguments. Shifting to a consumption tax would also imply an extremely complex transition that could be characterised by unemployment and inflation. For monetary policy, monitoring the economy during this transition would be extremely complex. Given the mixed picture that emerges from the analysis, I conclude asking why the consumption tax has taken such an echo in the current debate. May be because it is supposed to serve objectives that are not explicitly stated: either the objective of increasing competitiveness (but then, other tools like the exchange rate seem more straightforward and efficient), or the objective of reducing public spending.",0,test,235

155689443,"Sustainability is probably the ultimate goal of any entrepreneur when initiating or developing a business. As it involves competitiveness, companies aim to produce differentiated economic offerings by reusing and sharing processes, components, information and knowledge ? many times from different domains. However, to be effective, this should be envisaged already when developing the entrepreneurial plan or when assessing the opportunity of extending the business – therefore the need for planning / implementing / integrating several business lines (from various domains). As many of them may look attractive, an effective decision of starting one business line or another should be supported by some tool that allows a systematic assessment of the opportunity of implementing them. This paper proposes an algorithm that supports entrepreneurs in this respect. The opportunity of developing new business lines is assessed by estimating the mutual impact between them and existing business lines, their impact on organizational performance, and additional indicators such as financial effort, the estimated return on investment, technical and organizational difficulty, risk level or domain financing opportunities. An application example is presented in which an SME in an interdisciplinary domain (covering IT and life-sciences) assesses the opportunity of opening two new business lines.",0,test,198

Furthermore, this study has allowed us to reconfirm the relationship between ratio profiles of emotional intelligence and social behavior, reaffirming the need of further research that allow us to work on these issues to improve processes of social inclusion.",0,test,212
155058204,"Columbus, Ohio June 28, 20081 I watch the swimmers step onto the blocks, a stopwatch in my hand. Each athlete takes his position. Some intently wait to hear the buzzer; others look toward the stands. A spectator waves her hand at one of the athletes and cheers. A few more seconds pass. Then the buzzer sounds. Most competitors dive in, though the athlete in my lane needs a bit more encouragement. I glance to my right at Amber, the other timer in my lane. Rule one of volunteering at Special Olympics Ohio: Never tell an athlete “go” unless you mean it. Our eyes communicate what we don’t need to say. She and I cry “Go, John!” at the top of our lungs and watch him dive in after his competitors. We laugh as water flies onto our faces and clothing from the splash of his start. John takes off down the lane, inching closer to his competitors on the first lap of his 200-meter freestyle. * * * Modern sport spectators often exist in a liminal space. A story my mother tells about taking me at age three to watch my first local 12-and-under girls’ soccer match captures this feeling. Standing comfortably within my mother’s arms, I was supposedly mesmerized by the game for the first five minutes. When my mother reached for a water bottle, I instantly broke free and ran onto the field, crying, “Dana’s turn! Dana’s turn!” Luckily the girls were able to maneuver the ball around me until the referee called a timeout. Albeit brief, my experience as a spectator positioned me between two opposing desires: passively appreciating the home team and actively joining the fun. According to historian Allen Guttmann, many avid sports fans are in fact athletes themselves, as there is a “strong, positive correlation between active and passive sport participation.”2 Via this model we can begin to understand an organization like Special Olympics. Its motto, “Be a Fan,” speaks to the power, worth, and necessity of spectators in perpetuating the endeavors of the organization.3 The 2008 Swimming Championships of the Special Olympics Ohio Summer Games reminds us of the value of joining in the celebration of the human capacity for excellence, despite possible preconceived notions about competitors with special needs. 4",0,test,378

However, implementation of HiAP and a Healthy City approach faces challenges regarding the diversity of starting points, political will at higher levels, dependence on strong local engagement, and advocacy and public support. Special attention should be given to establish cross-sector collaboration over time and the need to raise awareness of conditions for good health to achieve HiAP on a local level.

26500768,"Although the waveform derived from a peripheral pulse monitor or pulse oximeter may resemble an arterialpressure waveform, it is in fact a visualization of blood volume change in transilluminated tissue caused by passage of blood: an indication of perfusion or bloodflow. Most currently available pulse oximeters indicate this flow, but few display it in usable form. Since adequate tissue blood flow is a prerequisite for normal metabolic activity, it is a parameter that should merit a place in standard anesthesia or intensive care monitors. That the peripheral tissue blood flow is not routinely displayed may be in part due to the difficulty in quantifying data obtained: flow is not accurately measured as simply as pressure, even by invasive means. It is in the pattern of the waveform that beat-to-beat changes in stroke volume can be better seen than measured, or in the interaction of ventilation and circulation that tests general circulatory performance. The origin and interpretation of these changes are discussed and illustrated with examples. We indicate how new physiological tests of autonomic function and cardiac preload can be developed using pulse plethysmography. The importance and application of the Valsalva effect on the waveform is emphasized. This effect is particularly applicable for monitoring adequate fluid loading and the action of vasodilator drugs, which are both important in anesthesia. Differences between the arterial pulse pressure wave and tissue flow wave are discussed, as well as the cause of certain artifacts, including the wandering dicrotic notch.",0,test,244
156693728,"Notions surrounding ‘creativity’ have become key elements of Dublin’s policy formation over the last decade. Predominantly, this policy focus has been influenced by Richard Florida’s ‘creative-class’ thesis. For Florida (2002), the future of urban economies revolves around the attraction and retention of the ‘creative class’. Loosely speaking, the ‘creative class’ comprises workers in fields such as the arts, academia, the sciences as well as the legal profession and business management. Florida suggests that in order to remain competitive, cities must promote the type of environment to which the ‘creative class’ is attracted because companies (and highly mobile investment capital) are attracted to where these individuals are located. This environment comprises city centre locations with high-quality amenities, such as bars, restaurants and good quality public space. Given the attraction of the city image projected by the ‘creative-class’ thesis, it has proved popular with city authorities on a global scale, and particularly in North America and Europe (Peck, 2005; Houston et al, 2008; Zimmerman, 2008). While the ‘creative-class’ concept emerged during a period of relative economic prosperity, it has proved a particularly resilient form of policy in the context of the global financial crisis.

49210553,"This paper addresses the generation of rents and the distribution of gains in the global operations of governed Global Value Chains (GVCs) and seeks to provide an architecture for analyzing the governance of GVCs. It distinguishes between four sets of rent—gifts of nature; innovation rents; exogenously defined rents; and market power—and three spheres of governance—setting the rules -“legislative governance”; implementing the rules -“executive governance”; and monitoring rules and sanctioning malfeasance -“judicial governance.” The exercise of governance power in GVCs over the generation, protection and appropriation of rents is considered though the lens of four sets of key GVC stakeholders—the corporate sector, civil society organizations, the nation state and supranational institutions. This general analysis is given flesh through three case studies: food-safety standards in GVCs; taxation policies and competition policies. In these sectors, the corporate sector is generally much more effective in governing rent generation and appropriation in the global operations of GVCs than are the three sets of non-corporate stakeholders. From this observation we offer a hypothesis that the capacity of non-corporate stakeholders, including national states, to govern GVCs is contingent upon the extent to which this coincides with the interest of the corporate sector. However, as noted, this balance of power between private and non-corporate actors is a contested terrain and dynamic in nature.",0,test,215
59490879,"The study of institutional change over a period of history involves several theoretical and methodological issues. In proposing a commentary on our article published in Vol. 17 n°3 of M@n@gement (Peton and Peze, 2014), Daudigeos, Boutinot and Jaumier have provided an opportunity to open up the debate, and we thank them for that. Their commentary concerns two major points: a methodological question concerning the choice of data in a historical research context, and a resulting reflection on the consideration given to collective representations in analysis of institutional work. Before replying in concrete terms to the points raised by Daudigeos et al., we wish to return to the objective of our article and clear up one matter they raise. Our study starts with reflection on the different institutional pillars. While Scott (2008) stresses the importance of all three pillars (normative, cognitive and regulative), the regulative pillar is rarely studied in the literature on change. It finds itself relegated to the role of a ratifier of changes driven by the cognitive and normative pillars, and has generally been considered static and treated as the same thing as the rule produced by the State (Scott, 2008; McCann, 1994). The case of Faute Inexcusable, an institutionalized practice introduced in 1898 and still in force today, reveals the complexity of a regulative pillar that has a real, and very specific, institutional dynamic. We can only agree with Daudigeos et al. when they stress the importance of paying attention to interaction between institutional pillars in institutional change. Our article focused mainly on the regulative pillar, such that we do not propose any contribution regarding interactions between pillars and their mutual effects – that was not our research project. However, our contribution to the understanding – and a form of intellectual rehabilitation – of the regulative pillar paves the way for a broader research agenda explicitly aimed at exploring the interaction dynamic between the pillars, without claiming to answer it comprehensively.",0,test,324

These assumptions include the quantification and commensurability of learning, teaching, and scholarship, the necessity of assessment and legitimation of accountability regimes, and the naturalness and universality of competition within postsecondary education.

However, the IBS subgroup with alternating bowel habits (IBS-A) has been poorly characterized. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVES ::: (i) To determine a set of bowel habit symptom criteria, which most specifically identifies IBS patients with an alternating bowel habit, (ii) to describe IBS-A bowel symptom patterns, and (iii) to compare clinical characteristics among IBS-A, constipation-predominant (IBS-C), and diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: One thousand one hundred and two Rome I positive IBS patients were analyzed. Three sets of potential criteria for IBS-A were developed and compared by multirater Kappa test. Gastrointestinal, psychological, extraintestinal symptoms, and health-related quality of life were compared in IBS-A, IBS-C, and IBS-D using chi(2) test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Stool consistency was determined to be the most specific criteria for alternating bowel habits. IBS-A patients reported rapid fluctuations in bowel habits with short symptom flares and remissions. There was a greater prevalence of psychological and extraintestinal symptoms in the IBS-A subgroup compared to IBS-C and IBS-D.

The aim of this study was to systematically test if these two aspects interact with each other. In Studies 1 and 2, we created hypothetical charity appeals related to the Syrian refugee crisis and factorially manipulated characteristics of victims possible to help (one identified child/nine non-identified children) and presence of statistical information about the scope and nature of the problem (information-box absent/present). We found a significant interaction effect both when using self-rated helping intention (Study 1), and when using actual donation behavior as the dependent variable (Study 2). Statistical information decreased helping intentions toward a single identified child but had no, or even a small positive effect on helping nine non-identified children. In Study 3, non-student participants reading a charity appeal with both a story about one identified child and statistical information donated less often than participants reading appeals with either only a story about one identified child or only statistical information. We suggest that both emotional arguments (e.g., a story and picture of an identified child in need) and analytical arguments (e.g., detailed statistical information about the scope and nature of the problem) can make us more motivated to help refugees, but that mixing different argument-types can make charity appeals internally inconsistent and decrease donations.",0,test,234

He explains that the Commission is essentially a new Australian economic institution focused on jobs and the economic prosperity of the people of Australia. He articulates his vision for the Commission and his desire that it be seen (like the Reserve Bank) as a respected, independent and expert economic organisation. Details are also revealed about how the Commission will undertake the challenging tasks of creating and publishing new pay scales and conduct its review into rationalising more than 105,000 pay classifications within about 4,000 pay scales.",0,test,135
145274280,"It has been argued that game studies scholars need to move beyond any understanding of gendered preferences in the content and mechanics of video games. Instead, we need to conceive of play as an assemblage, shaped through content, marketing, competency, experiences, access, context, and milieu (T.L. Taylor, 2008; Dovey & Kennedy, 2006; Jensen & de Castell, 2008). This paper considers and extends some of these observations on the complex networks of gendered gaming in light of the insights of a branch of science and technology studies known as feminist technoscience. Mobilizing in particular the work of Mol (1999) and Barad (1999), as well as preliminary findings from the author’s doctoral fieldwork, this paper considers the value of feminist technoscience concepts such as ontological politics, multiples, enactments, and agential realism in examinations of the gendered nature of game play.",0,test,138
154959620,"Social media content can spread quickly, particularly that generated by users themselves. This is a problem for businesses as user-generated content (UGC) often portrays brands negatively and, when mishandled, may turn into a crisis. This paper presents a framework for crisis management that incorporates insights from research on social media users' behaviour. It looks beyond specific platforms and tools, to develop general principles for communicating with social media users. The framework's relevance is illustrated via a widely publicised case of detrimental UGC. The paper proposes that, today, businesses need to identify relevant social media platforms, to monitor sentiment variances, and to go beyond simplistic metrics with content analysis. They also need to engage with online communities and the new influencers, and to respond quickly in a manner that is congruent with said social media platforms and their users' expectations. The paper extends the theoretical understanding of crisis management to consider the role of social media as both a cause and a solution to those crises. Moreover, it bridges information management",0,test,170
150910509,"In June 2006, experts on human rights and terrorism met in their individual capacities at the Faculty of Law, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada to develop the following Principles on Anti-terrorism and Human Rights. They shared a common view that the preservation of human rights - not least the right to life - is the central motivator of anti-terrorism. They also believed that human rights constitute an elemental and immutable constraint on how anti-terrorism is conducted. The struggle for collective security must not be an assault on the individual’s life, liberty and security of the person. This document is the product of their deliberations.",0,test,104
