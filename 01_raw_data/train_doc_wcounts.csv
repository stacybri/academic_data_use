20604786,This paper uses a new data set to estimate the causes and consequences of foreign currency debt in rms' balance sheet. The vidence from this sample of Chilean firms indicates that dollar-denominated debt is more used by larger firms and those more exposed to foreign competition. We find evidence that dollar denominated debt combines with exchange rate movements to produce a negative balance-sheet effect that reduces firm's investment in periods of strong exchange rate depreciation. This negative balance-sheet effect is associated with long term debt and appears to be non-linear in the amount of real exchange rate depreciation.,1,train,98
8334260,"This study was aimed at testing the hypothesis about the development of lateralization of frontal motor control (FMC) as a source of preference of the right hand human in early ontogeny. The sample consisted of 108 children aged from 8 months (the initial stage of maturation of inhibitory control in reaching) to 11 months (the definitive stage). The main results showed the following: (1) at the population level, the preference of the right hand in the performance of tests that require a definite level of development of FMC appears only at the age of 11 months, i.e., synchronously with development of frontal inhibitory control of reaching; (2) the preference of the right hand is substantially stronger in 11-month-old children with a higher level of development of inhibitory motor control as compared to other children of the same age; (3) the preference of the right hand is most evident for those movements that require inhibitory control (i.e., controlled reaching). On the whole, the data obtained show that the appearance of a preference for the right hand in the second half-year of the life of an infant is caused by the development of cortical inhibitory control over motor acts (FMC), associated with the maturation of the frontal neocortex.",1,train,206
62812273,"This paper considers a flexible panel data sample selection model in which (i) the outcome equation is permitted to take a semiparametric, varying coefficient form to capture potential parameter heterogeneity in the relationship of interest, (ii) both the outcome and (parametric) selection equations contain unobserved fixed effects and (iii) selection is generalized to a polychotomous case. We propose a two-stage estimator. Given consistent parameter estimates from the selection equation obtained in the first stage, we estimate the semiparametric outcome equation using data for the observed individuals whose likelihood of being selected into the sample stays approximately the same over time. The selection bias term is then ""asymptotically"" removed from the equation along with fixed effects using kernel-based weights. The proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. We first investigate the finite sample properties of the estimator in a small Monte Carlo study and then apply it to study production technologies of U.S. retail credit unions from 2002 to 2006.",1,train,159

Results demonstrate that ARC treatment was associated with significant decreases in child symptoms and caregiver stress from pre- to post-treatment, which were maintained over a 12-month follow up period. Preliminary findings contribute to an emerging empirical basis for the ARC model and are supportive of its clinical utility as a practice with adopted children. Next steps include; a) expanding study findings by conducting controlled efficacy research, b) examining the transaction between child and caregiver factors as agents of change, and c) conducting longitudinal research of children and families receiving ARC to more deeply examine impact on resiliency.",1,train,122
154379635,"Security regulators and the business press have alleged that firms play an 'earnings-guidance game' where analysts make optimistic forecasts at the start of the year and then 'walk down' their estimates to a level the firm can beat by the end of the year. In a comprehensive sample of I/B/E/S individual analysts' forecasts of annual earnings from 1983-1998, we find strong support for the claim in the post-1992 period. We examine whether the 'walk down' to beatable targets is associated with managers' incentives to sell stock after earnings announcements on the firm's behalf (via new equity issuance) or from their personal accounts (insider trades). Consistent with these hypotheses, we find that the 'walk down' to beatable targets is most pronounced in firms that are either net issuers of equity or in firms where managers are net sellers of stock after an earnings announcement. These findings provide new insights on how capital market incentives affect communications between managers and analysts.",1,train,159

Significant changes have taken place since deregulation in agriculture and the termination of subsidies from mid 1990s. The total area under grain has decreased by about 10% to 15% (C. Du Plessis, pers. commun. 2001) due to lower prices (based on import parity and free market forces) and the higher risk of production because of the absence of state subsidies.

The research was based on Ghanaian folklore for children, which is popularly known as ‘By the Fireside Stories’, encapsulated traditionally as Anansesem or Spider stories among the Akan of Ghana. Data were collected through storytelling to a group of children and inviting them to recall their concurrent thinking during and after the storytelling. The children’s cognitive recall processes were stimulated by questions and story character dramatisation recorded on a digital video recorder and played back to the children. Findings showed major contributions to children’s learning and development related to imagination, concept formation and thinking, and beyond the self in social relationship. This paper draws attention to how traditional oral storytelling can be an important part of early childhood education to develop children’s reflective thinking about social life.",1,train,174

168175597,"The saying that “first impressions remain forever in the mind” is also applicable when it comes to buying decision making. The package of a product has a high propensity of attracting a first time buyer of a beauty product who has no prior contact of the product. In the same way, it can also turn away the first buyer too. Packaging actually serves many purposes, ranging from product protection to attracting consumer attention. It is the selling tool that should promote and sell the product by catching consumers attention, defining the product’s identity, providing information, ensuring safe use and protecting the product. This study therefore seek to find out how much the package of a beauty product goes into the decision making process of the consumer. A non probability sampling method was used to select the sample size. A sample size of 50 consisting of 40 users of beauty product and 10 sellers of beauty product in the New Juaben Municipality was used. The findings made in the research were that, females have the highest percentage when it comes to beauty product usage, whiles users of beauty product mostly prefer a rubber containers, consumers consider the package of a beauty product before they make a purchase, and the level of influence packaging have on the consumers’ buying decision was high. However, majority said that packaging does not guarantee quality, but rather packaging does help in the following ways; catching consumers attention, defining the product identity, and protecting the product. It is therefore recommended at the end of the research that manufacturers and retailers must not under play the role that packaging plays in bringing consumers to a particular product.",1,train,279

Specifically, it was focused on researching strategies of refusal used by the participant, emerging frequency of each strategies, as well as appropriateness and accuracy of each strategy used. Sixty students majoring in Tourism were involved in the project. Discourse completion task (DCT) containing an invitation using three sociocultural aspects of low power (-P), low distance (-D), and low rank of imposition (-R) was used to elicit participants’ refusal strategies. Taxonomy of refusal proposed by Beebe, Takahashi, and Uliss-Weltz (1990) was applied to recognize refusal strategies used by participants. Result of the study revealed that there were three strategies of ‘direct, indirect, and adjunct to refusal’ used by participants in responding the invitation. However, two new sub-strategies found to enrich indirect strategies, they are ‘alternative (change subject)’ and ‘telling wish’. Dealing with participants’ appropriateness and accuracy, it could be concluded that their appropriateness in producing semantic formulas were higher than their accuracy (96,55% and 40,83%) respectively. In addition, there were two contradictive propositions finally underscored upon analysis of appropriateness and accuracy. In term of appropriateness, it is implied that L2 proficiency does not guarantee learners’ high appropriateness, which is in contrast with the Cordina-Espurz’s (2013) finding.

This parallel system for approaching minor crime has oourished, even as the mainstream criminal system faces a crisis of legitimacy. This Article examines whether we can apply aspects of the community justice movement to improve the processing of serious crime in the mainstream criminal system. It assesses current community justice practices—community prosecution, community courts, sentencing circles, and citizen reparative boards—and ands that they have structural and procedural defects that should bar their use for serious crime. However, the chief innovation of the community justice movement—localized, popular decision-making—would alleviate many of the problems facing the criminal justice system.

Design/methodology/approach - The data is generated by a large-scale postal questionnaire which was informed by preliminary interviews. Further interviews were carried out to aid interpretation of the responses. Descriptive statistics on the importance and frequency of use of individual practices provide the basis for discussion.Findings - Direct costing is widely practiced and important, by contrast with activity-based costing and full absorption costing. Despite the limitations of conventional budgets, they remain a central management accounting 'pillar' and are frequently used in 'what if?' analyzes. The balanced scorecard and other non-financial performance measures are perceived to be important but never or rarely used by 40% of companies. Product profitability analyzes are frequently applied, and, surprisingly, the profitability of supplying individual customers is frequently calculated by over 50% of the population. Respondents were skeptical about sophisticated DCF investment appraisals.Practical implications - Traditional management accounting is 'alive and well' but there are indications of likely increased use of: information concerning the cost of quality; non-financial measures relating to employees and analyzes of competitors' strengths and weaknesses.

The essay concludes that flat bans on metadata mining are misguided and that the issue should be treated in the same manner as inadvertent disclosures more generally. Under this approach, if a state permits lawyers to review inadvertently disclosed privileged documents, the jurisdiction should also permit lawyers to review the metadata contained in electronic documents. In contrast, if a jurisdiction prohibits the review of misdirected privileged documents, the state should ban metadata mining, but only when recipients have reason to believe that the metadata contains protected information.",0,train,146
158058049,"This paper presents an analysis of the land use and land cover change (LUCC) of major infrastructure construction as exemplified by the case of Hangzhou International Airport (HIA, Hangzhou, China), which is one of the busiest airports in Eastern China. The airport’s effect on LUCC is evaluated by comparing the actual pattern from 1996 to 2001 with a counterfactual simulated land use pattern that would have occurred without the intervention of airport construction. This research is based on land use maps from Landsat images that were analyzed by supervised classification and visual interpretation. To simulate the land use pattern occurring without airport construction, the counterfactual, we applied a cellular automata (CA)–Markov model. Through before and after comparison, we found that cultivated land has decreased and that constructed land has increased because of airport construction. However, according to the counterfactual scenario, airport construction to some extent prevented a decrease in cultivated land and decelerated the expansion of constructed land at a small scale and in the short term. We discuss several reasons for this result, including governmental regulations, such as the setting of the airport clearance area for the safety of plane take-off and landing, the adverse effects of aviation noise or pollution, which may limit the construction activities in the surrounding areas of the airport, and, importantly, the unique land use and land management system in China, mainly the cultivated land requisition-compensation balance policy. We conclude that (1) the counterfactual CA–Markov model simulation is a suitable and unbiased way of evaluating the effect of infrastructure on LUCC that can solve the deficiency in the previous literature relying on before and after comparisons and (2) regulatory, economic, and institutional factors should be considered when explaining and assessing the LUCC due to large infrastructure projects, such as airports, in China and in other countries.",1,train,302

Results from 463 participants showed the majority (78%) reported studying in a group at least once per semester, with younger students engaging in more frequent group sessions. Reasons for choosing group study included both learning and social factors. The majority experienced higher motivation and learning from group study, but the majority also generally prefer individual over group study. Regarding self-regulated learning choices in a group setting, these did vary by discipline, but the most commonly used strategies overall were active, empirically supported ones such as practice problems, discussion, quizzing/testing, questioning, and making flashcards. In addition, several group study strategies were correlated with GPA, including making mnemonics, making flashcards, and distributed (spaced) study sessions. More advanced students tended to use discussion-based strategies during group study, and lower-level students were more likely to report content-driven strategies such as quizzing/testing and flashcards. Also, frequency of group study was correlated with using more evidence-supported strategies, more efficient use of time, perceived improvements in learning, and preference for group study.

150861005,"Due to recent global discussions about climate change and its possible consequences, the implementation of environmental policy instruments with the intent to counteract the current environmental developments has become increasingly important. Environmental regulation as policy instrument is supposed to reduce or ideally minimize emissions and pollution. However, the question arises how effective such regulations are. Further on, it is not obvious whether these policy instruments rather repress innovation and economic growth than induce a shift toward a greener technology. To address these questions we investigate an endogenous growth model in an environmental context, introduced by M. Rauscher (Green R&D versus end-of-pipe emission abatement: a model of directed technical change (Thuenen-Series of Applied Economic Theory, Working Paper 106), 2009). Rauscher investigates the impact of environmental standards on capital accumulation and R&D investments in an economy where both, brown (dirty) as well as green (clean) capital can be used in production. While Rauscher keeps the problem formulation rather general without assuming specific model functions, our focus is to apply optimal control theory to a specific scenario of this model.",0,train,177

A geometrically focused piston transducer is used as the acoustic source. Signals are cross-correlated to find the true sound speed during the measurement to make the simulated and measured pulses in phase for comparisons. The calculated sound speed in the measurement is varied between 1487.45 m/s and 1487.75 m/s by using different initial values in the ASA simulation. Results from the pulsed ASA simulations using both Field II simulated and hydrophone measured acoustic sources are compared to the Field II simulated and hydrophone measured pulses, respectively. The total relative root mean square (RMS) errors of the pulsed ASA are investigated by using different time-point, zero-padding factors, spatial sampling interval and temporal sampling frequency in the simulation. Optimal parameters for the ASA are found in the simulation. The RMS error of the ASA simulation is reduced from 10.9% to 2.4% for the optimal parameters when comparing to Field II simulations. The comparison between the ASA calculated and measured pulses are illustrated and the corresponding RMS error is 25.4%.",1,train,187

The experiment tests the effect of virtual currency endowments on player retention and virtual currency demand. An increase in endowments of a virtual currency should lower the demand for the currency in the short run. However, in the long run, we would expect money demand to rise in response to inflation in the virtual world. We test for this behavior in a virtual field experiment in the football management game Top11. 575,000 players were selected at random and allocated to different ""shards"" or versions of the world. The shards differed only in terms of the initial money endowment offered to new players. Money demand was observed for 28 days as players used real money to purchase additional virtual currency. The results indicate that player money purchases were significantly higher in the shards where higher endowments were given. This suggests that a positive change in the money supply in a virtual context leads to inflation and increased money demand, and does so much more quickly than in real-world economies. Differences between virtual and real currency behavior will become more interesting as virtual currency becomes a bigger part of the real economy.",1,train,204

This study verifies that when audit risk and business risk are considered simultaneously, the effect of audit risk on audit fees and hours diminishes with lower business risk. Auditors are less concerned about audit risk in less competitive markets than in highly competitive markets because auditor is less exposed to litigation risk due to the nature of less competition.

Banking is an institutionally-intensive activity and the location decision of foreign banks provides a good test of how institutional differences are dealt with and how they may affect economic choices. Specifically, the authors examine whether banks seek out those markets where institutional familiarity provides them with a competitive advantage over other foreign competitor banks. Using bilateral data on banking sector foreign direct investment in all developing countries and controlling for other factors, they find that competitive advantage is an important factor in driving foreign banks'location decisions. The findings suggest that high institutional quality is not necessarily a prerequisite to attract foreign direct investment in banking and that there are specific benefits, as well as risks, to international financial integration between developing countries.",1,train,149

The women job-seekers find jobs in banks more attractive and more suitable to their nature. Banks also were not only not averse to taking them but even welcomed their entry because women have certain innate traits which fit in with the job requirements. Thus the humongous increase in job opportunities in banks and the abundant availability of qualified women who get selected in job tests paved the way for the large number of women occupying positions in all cadres today in not only public sector and private sector banks but even in new generation banks. Indian women is distinct from their western counter parts in that they do not shed their conventional roles as mothers and house wives inspire of their professional responsibilities. They are skilled at blending professional excellence and traditional love for home harmoniously. In the process of balancing work and home life, they encounter a plethora of problems. The study is purely exploratory in nature and seeks to identify the factors preventing women employees from aspiring for higher post and problems hindering the work performance of women executives in private sector banks in Puducherry state. Further this aims also at finding out the organizational support for women employees to achieve better work performance. The conclusion has been given.",1,train,229

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the approach and status of sustainable, low-carbon transport policy in ASEAN countries and identifies differences and similarities. The methodology is based on a taxonomy of policy components as developed by Howlett and Cashore. The data come from comprehensive country studies for Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam and interviews with policymakers. We find that each country has a specific set of goals, objectives and targets that support sustainable transport, and, directly or indirectly, climate change mitigation. In terms of specific mechanisms and calibrations, which we analyse based on the Avoid−Shift−Improve approach, there are notable differences between the countries, for example in terms of fuel economy policy. Even though an initial response to climate change mitigation challenges is visible in these countries’ transport policies, much more effort is required to enable a transition to a transport system compatible with long-term climate change and sustainable development targets.",1,train,180
19178965,"Background: Disasters affect close to 400 million people each year. Complex Emergencies (CE) are a category of disaster that affects nearly half of the 400 million and often last for several years. To support the people affected by CE, humanitarian assistance is provided with the aim of saving lives and alleviating suffering. It is widely agreed that funding for this assistance should be needs-based. However, to date, there is no model or set of indicators that quantify and compare needs from one CE to another. In an effort to support needs-based and transparent funding of humanitarian assistance, the aim of this study is to develop a model that distinguishes between levels of severity among countries affected by CE.Methods: In this study, severity serves as a predictor for level of need. The study focuses on two components of severity: vulnerability and exposure. In a literature and Internet search we identified indicators that characterize vulnerability and exposure to CE. Among the more than 100 indicators identified, a core set of six was selected in an expert ratings exercise. Selection was made based on indicator availability and their ability to characterize preexisting or underlying vulnerabilities (four indicators) or to quantify exposure to a CE (two indicators). CE from 50 countries were then scored using a 3-tiered score (Low-Moderate, High, Critical). Results: The developed model builds on the logic of the Utstein template. It scores severity based on the readily available value of four vulnerability and four exposure indicators. These are 1) GNI per capita, PPP, 2) Under-five mortality rate, per 1 000 live births, 3) Adult literacy rate, % of people ages 15 and above, 4) Underweight, % of population under 5 years, and 5) number of persons and proportion of population affected, and 6) number of uprooted persons and proportion of population uprooted.Conclusion: The model can be used to derive support for transparent, needs-based funding of humanitarian assistance. Further research is needed to determine its validity, the robustness of indicators and to what extent levels of scoring relate to CE outcome.",1,train,339

9294789,"Mental health policy-making in Ontario has a long history of frustrated attempts to move from a hospital and physician-based tradition to a coordinated system with greater emphasis on community-based mental health care. This study examines policy legacies associated with the introduction of psychiatric hospitals in the 1850s and the introduction of public health insurance (medicare) in the 1960s in Ontario; and their effect on subsequent mental health reform initiatives using a qualitative case study approach. Following Pierson (1993) we capture the resource/incentive and interpretive effects of prior policies on three groups of actors: government elites, interests and mass publics. Data is drawn from academic and policy literature, and key informant interviews. The findings suggest that psychiatric hospital policy resulted in important policy legacies which were reinforced by medicare. These legacies explain the traditional difficulty in achieving mental health reform, but are less helpful in explaining recent promising developments that support community-based care. Current reform of the Ontario health system features the introduction of regionalized service delivery and new models of interdisciplinary team-based primary care delivery and presents an opportunity to overcome several of these legacies. The analysis suggests a pressing need to link these two initiatives to overcome system fragmentation.",1,train,200

For faster new product development decisions, we implement a flexible prioritization methodology for product features and concepts, one that scales up in the number of testable alternatives, limited only by the number of participants. Preferences are measured by trading stocks whose prices are based upon share of choice of new products and features. We develop a conceptual model of scalable preference markets, and test it experimentally.

Consistent with our findings from previous work, party leaders appeared to construct more moderate and less divisive agendas in lame-duck sessions, which reflected leaders’ reduced ability to influence the behavior of departing members. The ability of party leaders to exert pressure in lame-duck sessions did not disappear, however, but rather took a different form: that of getting returning members to participate actively on roll-call votes.

One of PQS’s strengths deals with the Q-sort methodology (Block, 1961; Stephenson, 1953) that enables both an empirical study of human subjectivity (McKnown & Thomas, 1988) and the application of rigorous data analysis for single-case designs, such as the P-technique and time series analysis.

32650545,"Abstract Radiocontrast administration remains the third leading cause of hospital-acquired acute renal failure. Clinically, radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RIN) is defined as a sudden decline in renal function after radiocontrast administration. Typically, the serum creatinine level begins to increase at 24 to 72 hours after the administration of contrast, peaks at 3 to 5 days, and requires another 3 to 5 days to return to baseline. RIN increases the incidence of life-threatening complications such as sepsis, bleeding, and respiratory failure and increases the cost of medical care by extending the hospital stay. The increased mortality associated with acute renal failure encountered in this scenario calls for a heightened awareness of the diagnosis and prevention of RIN. Whereas individuals with healthy renal function are not generally considered to be at particular risk for RIN, patients with preexisting renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus are much more likely to experience acute renal failure after contrast administration. In the past, a variety of therapeutic interventions have been used to prevent or attenuate RIN, including saline hydration, diuretics, mannitol, calcium channel antagonists, theophylline, endothelin receptor antagonists, hemodialysis, and dopamine. More recently, studies demonstrate a positive impact of fenoldopam (dopamine-1 receptor, dopamine-1 agonist) and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine in ameliorating RIN.

Neuroimaging tools useful in the diagnostic evaluation of epilepsy surgical candidates have now been shown to be useful in predicting memory change in the post-surgical period. Functional magnetic resonance imaging appears to provide significant information regarding hemispheric representation of language in the temporal lobe epilepsy patient, and the use of this technique to predict memory status following surgery appears promising.

14440941,"MAIN CONCLUSION ::: Changes in root and leaf hydraulic properties and stimulation of transpiration rates that were initially triggered by defoliation were accompanied by corresponding changes in leaf and root aquaporin expression. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings were subjected to defoliation treatments by removing 50, 75 % or all of the leaves. Root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) was sharply reduced in plants defoliated for 1 day and 1 week. The decrease in L pr could not be prevented by stem girdling and it was accompanied in one-day-defoliated plants by a large decrease in the root expression of PIP1,2 aquaporin and an over twofold decrease in hydraulic conductivity of root cortical cells (L pc). Contrary to L pr and L pc, 50 and 75 % defoliation treatments profoundly increased leaf lamina conductance (K lam) after 1 day and this increase was similar in magnitude for both defoliation treatments. Transpiration rates (E) rapidly declined after the removal of 75 % of leaves. However, E increased by over twofold in defoliated plants after 1 day and the increases in E and K lam were accompanied by five- and tenfold increases in the leaf expression of PIP2;4 in 50 and 75 % defoliation treatments, respectively. Defoliation treatments also stimulated net photosynthesis after 1 day and 3 weeks, although the increase was not as high as E. Leaf water potentials remained relatively stable following defoliation with the exception of a small decrease 1 day after defoliation which suggests that root water transport did not initially keep pace with the increased transpirational water loss. The results demonstrate the importance of root and leaf hydraulic properties in plant responses to defoliation and point to the involvement of PIP aquaporins in the early events following the loss of leaves.",1,train,289

Factors related to workplace hypertension were assessed with multiple regression analysis. Workplace hypertension, defined as a BP no less than 140/90 mmHg, was observed in 23% of subjects (n=61). Compared with subjects without workplace hypertension (n=204), subjects with workplace hypertension were older (48.5+/-10.0 vs. 39.3+/-10.0 years), more likely to be men (69% vs. 46%), and had a higher body mass index (BMI) (23.4+/-2.7 vs. 21.6+/-3.2 kg/m(2)), higher cholesterol levels (214+/-33 vs. 194+/-36 mg/dl), and a higher Brinkman index (134+/-228 vs. 59+/-148).

151954792,"Abstract This paper discusses questions about sources of knowledge in Dutch police interviews with child witnesses. Police officers are instructed to ask these questions in order to allow participants in the criminal procedure to assess the reliability of the testimony. In everyday interaction, asking “how someone knows” implies that what was said earlier is not taken for granted. Therefore, questions about sources of knowledge in police interviews are potentially delicate. This paper aims to show that (a) questions about sources of knowledge are related to a specialized institutional inference system and (b) children sometimes treat those questions as causing a dilemma between the need to provide an answer and the unusual character of the question. Drawing on insights from conversation analysis, the analysis focuses on occasions when children present their answer about the source of their knowledge as self-evident. These responses suggest that the question is not genuine and legitimate. At the same time, children still try to provide a relevant answer. The self-evident answers thus deal with the explicit request for a source of knowledge and, from their perspective, the unnecessary character of the question. Police officers generally ignore the self-evident aspect of the answers in their uptakes. Yet, when they do orient to it, they justify their questions as genuine information seeking questions. Police officers thus treat sources of knowledge as something they did not know, whereas sources of knowledge often can be inferred in everyday language use. We suggest that taking this unknowing stance conveys to the child and to the tape that the police officers are not presuming specific sources of knowledge.",1,train,266

168071818,"Using an original data set of start-up firms in Japan, this paper investigates whether post-entry performance differs between start-up firms, according to the source of finance. In particular, the difference among firms that used entrepreneur' s own savings (insider finance), bank borrowing, and risk capital from business angels or venture capital firms is focused upon. It is found that start-up firms financed by business angels are more likely to increase sales even after controlling entrepreneur, firm, and industry characteristics. On the other hand, the use of entrepreneurs' own savings and financing from founding members and family (quasi-insider finance) negatively influence post-entry performance. In addition, it is not found that those financed by banks tend to grow.",1,train,116

18142553,"Bats are natural reservoirs for the majority of lyssaviruses globally, and are unique among mammals in having exceptional sociality and longevity. Given these facets, and the recognized status of bats as reservoirs for rabies viruses (RABVs) in the Americas, individual bats may experience repeated exposure to RABV during their lifetime. Nevertheless, little information exists with regard to within-host infection dynamics and the role of immunological memory that may result from abortive RABV infection in bats. In this study, a cohort of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) was infected intramuscularly in the left and right masseter muscles with varying doses [10−0.1–104.9 median mouse intracerebral lethal doses (MICLD50)] of an E. fuscus RABV variant isolated from a naturally infected big brown bat. Surviving bats were infected a second time at 175 days post-(primary) infection with a dose (103.9–104.9 MICLD50) of the same RABV variant. Surviving bats were infected a third time at either 175 or 305 days post-(secondary) infection with a dose (104.9 MICLD50) of the same RABV variant. When correcting for dose, similar mortality was observed following primary and secondary infection, but reduced mortality was observed following the third and last RABV challenge, despite infection with a high viral dose. Inducible RABV-neutralizing antibody titres post-infection were ephemeral among infected individuals, and dropped below levels of detection in several bats between subsequent infections. These results suggest that long-term repeated infection of bats may confer significant immunological memory and reduced susceptibility to RABV infection.",1,train,241

Technological progress has increased the importance of the international division of labor and of global production and distribution networks. Multinational corporatios have been a driving force behind these developments. As a transition economy, Poland provides an interesting case for study, as its sudden opening to foreign investment after a long period of isolation allows the process of integratio into global networks to be studies more clearly. Using Poland as a case study, the authors study multinational corporatios'role in integrating a host country into the increasingly international division of labor. They provide evidence that inflows of foreign direct investment are increasing Poland's participation in global production and distribution networks. They conclude that because of the large volume of foreign direct investment inflows expected in Poland in the near future, Poland's exports--driven by fragmented production production--will continue to expand at even faster rates than observed there recently.",0,train,188

A number of researchers have investigated the effectiveness of concept mapping on student academic achievement. The main focus of these studies have been on comparing the effectiveness of concept mapping to traditional teaching practices such as the lecture method. This research, however, compares concept mapping to tutorial sheets strategy in teaching circular and rotational motion. A sample of 70 students participated in the experiment. An equivalent number of 35 students were assigned to the control and experimental group. The control group used tutorial sheets while the experimental group used concept mapping. A pre-test and post-test was administered to the two groups. A t-test was used to compare the means of the group’s test scores. The mean score for the experimental group’s post test was higher than the mean score of the control group. This showed that concept mapping was more effective than the tutorial sheet strategy.

Here, we modeled current and future snakebite risk using ecological niche models (ENMs) of 90 venomous snake taxa. Current snakebite risk predictions were corroborated by incidence data from eight regions/periods with different characteristics. Detailed projections of potential future range shifts on distributions of the medically most relevant species indicated that North American species’ ranges are likely to increase in the future, but mixed results were obtained for Latin American snakes. A likely expansion of overall risk area and an increase of rural population at risk were observed from a consensus model among future scenarios. Our study highlights the capacity of ENMs to provide detailed information on current and future potential distributions of venomous snakes, as well as useful perspectives on snakebite risk, at least broad scales.",1,train,148

These practices can be shared and learned to increase the probability of brand integration success in future M&As. The paper adopts the case-study method by interviewing several top-level executives, M&A managers, functional managers and members of M&A projects which have been involved in M&As. Twenty practices are outlined and defined after analysing ten M&A events within six case companies (which are multinational corporations – MNCs). The paper provides managers with insights into good (or winning) practices that MNCs have adopted in integrating brands in their M&As by addressing a number of specific issues and corresponding solutions. The twenty practices for the integration of brands in M&As are classified into eight major clusters according to the dimensions of brand and brand management these practices are related to – brand strategic positioning, brand people, brand knowledge transfer, brand integration planning, brand integration implementation, brand disposal expertise, brand disposal negotiation, and brand due diligence. These clusters allow M&A and integration managers to accumulate their own brand integration practices from time to time systematically.

155900049,"ICWA is one of the foundational laws of federal Indian law, but it usually arises in the broader public consciousness when there is a voluntary adoption subject to the law. Recently, the law was subject to Supreme Court review in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. A heart-wrenching case, but ICWA is far more regularly applied in abuse and neglect cases. Any involuntary removal of an American Indian child, as defined by the Act, requires the application of ICWA. While cases of voluntary adoptions designed to thwart the requirements of ICWA require constant vigilance from states and tribes, the law provides broader protections for those families in the state child welfare system. This article posits one way to both collect data about abuse and neglect compliance within the framework of ICWA, and increase that compliance through collaborative change to the systems. QUICWA, a project by the Minneapolis American Indian Center, consists of a group of interested stakeholders who have created a checklist to measure what happens in each individual hearing where the court must apply ICWA. While other groups, such as the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, use a different checklist format, the goal of the projects are similar — to find ways to increase compliance with ICWA. Funded in collaboration with Casey Family Programs, law schools and social work programs in key states have started observing ICWA hearings using the QUICWA checklist. In Michigan, the Michigan State University College of Law has observed ICWA hearings in three counties, using law students as observers.

In two experiments, we demonstrated that a Black male drive-by shooter’s level of phenotypic stereotypicality is accurately identified by eyewitnesses only when the victims are Black males. Specifically, when eyewitnesses believe the victims are White or female, the drive-by shooter’s level of Black phenotypic stereotypicality is falsely elevated.

However an understanding of the use and barriers to nutrition and psychological injury prevention strategies is not currently known. This information may prove useful in the multidisciplinary environment of elite sport. Objective The objective of this study was to understand the use of exercise, nutrition and psychology injury prevention strategies, identify barriers/facilitators to implementation and preferred methods of knowledge dissemination to athletes. Design An online survey was developed based upon theories of behaviour change and injury surveillance in multi-sport event guidelines. Setting Elite (International/National standard) athletes from a variety of sports. Participants Athletes were randomly recruited from (n=50). Assessment of Risk Factors Athletes completed a questionnaire assessing risk perceptions, prevention beliefs, injury prevention strategy use, injury location/type target, outcome expectancies, barriers/facilitators to injury strategy use and current/preferred channels of information dissemination. Main Outcome Measurements Exercise, nutrition and psychology injury prevention strategy use and barriers/facilitators to strategy use. Results Preliminary findings indicate athletes did not engage with any evidence-based multi-component injury prevention programmes but the majority of athletes reported using at least one exercise-based strategy (97% of athletes) and nutrition-based strategy (97%), but fewer athletes used at least one psychology-based strategy (75%). The most common barriers reported by athletes were a lack of relative advantage for exercise-based strategies and poor how-to-knowledge, principles-knowledge and trialability particularly for nutrition and psychology-based strategies. The most common facilitators were similar across all three injury prevention strategies. These were a performance benefit, injury prevention benefit, relevance, awareness-knowledge, and usefulness. Conclusions No athletes engaged with an evidence-based injury prevention program but many used at least one exercise, nutrition or psychology injury prevention strategy.

152364019,"Informational privacy is the ability to determine for yourself when and how others may collect and use your information. Adequate informational privacy requires a sufficiently broad ability to give or withhold free and informed consent to proposed uses.Notice and Choice (sometimes also called “notice and consent”) is the current paradigm for consent online. The Notice is a presentation of terms, typically in a privacy policy or terms of use agreement. The Choice is an action signifying acceptance of the terms, typically clicking on an “I agree” button, or simply using the website. Recent reports by the Federal Trade Commission explicitly endorse the Notice and Choice approach (and provide guidelines for its implementation). When the Notice contains information about data collection and use, the argument for Notice and Choice rests on two claims. First: a fully adequate implementation of the paradigm would ensure that website visitors can give free and informed consent to data collection and use practices. Second: the combined effect of all the individual decisions is an acceptable overall tradeoff between privacy and the benefits of collecting and using consumers’ data. There are (we contend) decisive critiques of both claims. So why do policy makers and privacy advocates continue to endorse Notice and Choice?Most likely, they see no need to seek an alternative. We find the critique of Notice and Choice conclusive, but our assessment is far from widely shared — and understandably so. Criticisms of Notice and Choice are scattered over several articles and books. No one has unified them and answered the obvious counterarguments. We do so. Making the critique plain, however, is not enough to ensure that policy makers turn to a viable alternative. The critiques are entirely negative; they do not offer any alternative to Notice and Choice. We offer an alternative: informational norms. When appropriate informational norms govern online data collection and use, they both ensure that visitors give free and informed consent to those practices, and yield an acceptable overall tradeoff between protecting privacy and the benefits of processing information. A fundamental difficulty is the lack of norms. Rapid advances in information processing technology have fueled new business models, and the rapid development has outpaced the slow evolution of norms. Notice and Choice cannot be pressed into service to remedy this lack. It is necessary to develop new norms.",0,train,386
158792440,"Abstract Authorities around the world are constantly evaluating new ways to justify the implementation of capital intensive transport infrastructure such as urban rail solutions. Traditionally, the benefits of an urban rail line are calculated on the basis of user benefits such as savings in travel time, vehicle operating costs, accident costs and environmental costs, and more recently wider economic benefits. An alternative approach that is sometimes used is to consider the appreciation of property prices along a rail corridor, and the intensification of land development surrounding a rail station. Using the development of new rail lines in Singapore as a case study, this paper will first apply the hedonic regression method to obtain estimates of elasticity between property price and transport accessibility. Secondly, using historical land use masterplans, the paper will discuss how the density of land use adjacent to rail stations has intensified over the past 15 years, through a comparative analysis of the land use density with respect to the distance to a rail station. Finally, with the North East Line as an example, the alternative approach comprising the land value enhancement of existing properties and the land intensification due to proximity to the line will be compared against the conventional user benefits.",1,train,205

Historically, Pakistan relied on both American and Chinese security assistance in balancing against India while India relied more on the former Soviet Union and the US in its balancing game against Pakistan. As current geopolitical dynamics unfold with the US pivot to Asia, the rivalry and competition between the US and China is intensifying, bringing with it a similar dynamic in South Asia as Pakistan moves closer to China and India consolidates its alliance with the US.

Evidence also suggests that metabolism of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor for biological methylation, is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. We investigated the effect of SAM on mtDNA density and insulin sensitivity using the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. To determine the short-term effect on mtDNA density, SAM (15 mg kg -1 d -1 ) was administered intraperitoneally for 7 d to 6 male, 57-wk-old OLETF rats and 6 Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats of the same age as a nondiabetic control. To determine the long-term effect, the same dose of SAM was administered daily to 5 male, 6-wk-old OLETF rats until the age of 25 wk; 7 control OLETF rats received vehicle and 7 LETO rats were untreated. Skeletal muscle mtDNA density was measured by either competitive or multiplex PCR and insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. SAM treatment for 1 wk increased skeletal muscle mtDNA density of both OLETF and LETO rats. The long-term SAM treatment significantly reduced body weight gain as well as increased skeletal muscle mtDNA density and whole body insulin sensitivity in OLETF rats compared with their vehicle-treated controls. Furthermore, in all 3 groups, skeletal muscle mtDNA density correlated with insulin sensitivity (r= 0.752, P < 0.001).

This paper presents four sometimes conflicting principles for the conduct of ethical and high-quality science using such data: protection of confidentiality, the social–spatial linkage, data sharing, and data preservation. The conflict among these four principles is particularly evident in the display of spatially explicit data through maps combined with the sharing of tabular data files. This paper reviews these two research activities and shows how current practices favor one of the principles over the others and do not satisfactorily resolve the conflict among them. Maps are indispensable for the display of results but also reveal information on the location of respondents and sampling clusters that can then be used in combination with shared data files to identify respondents. The current practice of sharing modified or incomplete data sets or using data enclaves is not ideal for either the advancement of science or the protection of confidentiality. Further basic research and open debate are needed to advance both understanding of and solutions to this dilemma.",1,train,224
58932139,"The process by which universities internationalize their education mission and adopt the ‘third mission’ of economic development in their local region is widely documented. However, little is known about how transnational educational campuses adopt research and economic development functions. This case study draws on interviews, historical documents, and bibliometric and patent analysis to describe the efforts of one of the longest standing US transnational campuses—Georgia Tech Lorraine—to integrate into the Lorraine region of France by adding research and economic development missions. In describing the campus’s evolution, this article highlights key markers indicating the transition to novel competencies. The results indicate that the adoption of new missions is characterized by plans, mixed success, and re-orientation rather than by a directed or designed process. Additionally, the study suggests that efforts to transplant successful programs from the home university to the Lorraine campus were less successful than those involving host region-led partnerships.",1,train,149
167500892,"This paper argues for three basic changes in the model of airport security that have been employed in the United States since the passage of the Air Transportation Security Act (ATSA) legislation in 2001. The changes are to: (1) remove the Transportation Safety Administration's (TSA’s) conflict of interest by making it the policy-maker and regulator, but not the provider, of airport screening; (2) desolve screening responsibility to the airport level, under the supervision of the TSA’s Federal Security Director in each case; and (3) shift the paradigm from an equal-risk model to a genuinely risk-based model of airport security. These changes would improve airport security in many ways. They would target more of the available resources (both people and equipment) toward those passengers who pose relatively greater risk of harm, thereby getting more bang for the buck. By making all on-airport security functions the responsibility of the airport, this approach would lead to a more integrated approach, with the Federal Security Director (FSD) supervising everything.",0,train,165
13686166,"Advances in soft robotics, materials science, and stretchable electronics have enabled rapid progress in soft grippers. Here, a critical overview of soft robotic grippers is presented, covering different material sets, physical principles, and device architectures. Soft gripping can be categorized into three technologies, enabling grasping by: a) actuation, b) controlled stiffness, and c) controlled adhesion. A comprehensive review of each type is presented. Compared to rigid grippers, end-effectors fabricated from flexible and soft components can often grasp or manipulate a larger variety of objects. Such grippers are an example of morphological computation, where control complexity is greatly reduced by material softness and mechanical compliance. Advanced materials and soft components, in particular silicone elastomers, shape memory materials, and active polymers and gels, are increasingly investigated for the design of lighter, simpler, and more universal grippers, using the inherent functionality of the materials. Embedding stretchable distributed sensors in or on soft grippers greatly enhances the ways in which the grippers interact with objects. Challenges for soft grippers include miniaturization, robustness, speed, integration of sensing, and control. Improved materials, processing methods, and sensing play an important role in future research.",0,train,187

On the other hand, no significant effect was found between age cohorts and current financial resources but older age cohorts were relatively more significant predictors.",1,train,116
32552444,"Background: Female-breadwinner families represent a relatively new phenomenon in Europe. Little is known about the determinants of this couple type, which sensibly diverts from the traditional economic superiority of men within the household. Objective: This paper studies the contextual correlates of partners’ contribution to the household income, distinguishing between female-breadwinner, male-breadwinner, and equal-income couples. In particular, it focuses on the role of male unemployment rate and the prevalence of gender-egalitarian attitudes as possible explanations for the emergence of female-breadwinner and equal-income couples across European regions and countries. Methods: Using data from the fifth round (2010/2011) of the European Social Survey, integrated with data from the Eurostat database, we model the categorical variable identifying the couple type (male-breadwinner, female-breadwinner, or equal-income couple) by using a multilevel multinomial logistic regression model where individuals are nested within regions and countries. Results: The prevalence of female-breadwinner, male-breadwinner, and equal-income couples varies considerably across European countries as well as within countries. The prevalence of female-breadwinner couples is positively associated with male unemployment, while it is not influenced by the diffusion of gender-egalitarian attitudes. However, the diffusion of gender-egalitarian attitudes matters for explaining the variation in the prevalence of equal-income couples across Europe. Contribution: We add to the literature on partners’ contributions to household income by analysing the spatial distribution and the contextual correlates of female-breadwinner, male-breadwinner, and equal-income couples across European countries and regions.",1,train,229

To identify monetary policy effects on wage inequality between and within firms, we exploit the interaction of nominal interest rate movements around the zero lower bound with variation in pre-determined balance sheet exposure of banks and their lending relations with firms. We find significant increases in credit supply of affected banks, leading to increased within-firm inequality.

206560295,"Objective To improve the biocompatibility between polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane and pancreatic stem cells, rat fibroblasts were used to modify the polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane. Meanwhile, we constructed artificial islet tissue by compound culturing the pancreatic stem cells and the fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane and explored the function of artificial islets in diabetic nude mice. Methods Pancreatic stem cells were cultured on the fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane in dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing activin-A, β-catenin, and exendin-4. The differentiated pancreatic stem cells combined with modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane were implanted subcutaneously in diabetic nude mice. The function of artificial islet tissue was explored by detecting blood levels of glucose and insulin in diabetic nude mice. Moreover, the proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic stem cells on modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane as well as the changes on the tissue structure of artificial islets were investigated by immunofluorescence and haematoxylin and eosin staining. Results The pancreatic stem cells differentiated into islet-like cells and secreted insulin when cultured on fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane. Furthermore, when the artificial islet tissues were implanted into diabetic nude mice, the pancreatic stem cells combined with polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane modified by fibroblasts proliferated, differentiated, and secreted insulin to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic nude mice. Conclusion Pancreatic stem cells can be induced to differentiate into islet-like cells in vitro. In vivo, the artificial islet tissue can effectively regulate the blood glucose level in nude mice within a short period. However, as time increased, the structure of the artificial islets was destroyed due to the erosion of blood cells that resulted in the gradual loss of artificial islet function.",0,train,276

This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that the term business value in agile contexts is not clearly defined, even though the creation of business value is one of the central themes in agile and lean development. In this paper, we propose a model for business value that is intended to make explicit different factors that constitute the concept of business value in agile and lean software development.

What can we reasonably expect Chinese emissions trends to look like over the next two decades? Secondly, what would be the appropriate policy interventions to flatten Chinese emissions trajectories and reduce the risk of local, regional, and even global adversity? This research is original in its direct use of the new industrial sector-level emissions and energy using data from China to estimate the energy-specific emission effluent rate and its detailed treatment of policies taking account of the three main determinants of pollution intensity: growth, output composition, and technological change. Our results indicate that, without further effective emission control measures, China’s economic growth over the next two decades will contribute significantly to SO2 emission problems, in which the emission increase from the rapid expansion of the transportation service sectors will be the most remarkable. However, detailed examination of the structural and technological components of pollution shows that efficient pollution mitigation can be realized by focused abatement activities, cleaner production, and advances in cleaner fuel products and their use technologies.",1,train,188

Eye-tracking is utilised at the interface between the human and the technology side of digitalisation and it is exactly at that interface, where technological innovations translate into economic values through productivity gains, increased sales, higher realised prices, improved customer satisfaction, fewer litigation cases, longer lasting customer relationships and thereby increased lifetime customer value, more profitable management decisions and improved shareholder trust. Unfortunately, numerous frictions between “machines” and humans exist at these interfaces. Over the last decades, scientists have refined methods and invented tools to detect those frictions, reflected in visual perception: eye-tracking. While the causes of these frictions are countless, eye-tracking is a single scientific method for detecting very many of them. Eye-tracking – so to speak – is “digitalisation’s best friend”.

18043802,"We use OLS and logistic regression to investigate variation in husband and wife perspectives on the division of authority over agriculture-related decisions within households in rural Tanzania. Using original data from husbands and wives (interviewed separately) in 1,851 Tanzanian households, the analysis examines differences in the wife’s authority over 13 household and farming decisions. The study finds that the level of decision-making authority allocated to wives by their husbands, and the authority allocated by wives to themselves, both vary significantly across households. In addition to commonly considered assets such as women’s age and education, in rural agricultural households women’s health and labor activities also appear to matter for perceptions of authority. We also find husbands and wives interviewed separately frequently disagree with each other over who holds authority over key farming, family, and livelihood decisions. Further, the results of OLS and logistic regression suggest that even after controlling for various individual, household, and regional characteristics, husband and wife claims to decision-making authority continue to vary systematically by decision—suggesting that decision characteristics themselves also matter. The absence of spousal agreement over the allocation of authority (i.e., a lack of “intra-household accord”) over different farm and household decisions is problematic for interventions seeking to use survey data to develop and inform strategies for reducing gender inequalities or empowering women in rural agricultural households. Findings provide policy and program insights into when studies interviewing only a single spouse or considering only a single decision may inaccurately characterize intra-household decision-making dynamics.",1,train,247

Up to now, the distinct structure and morphology of intact and degenerate human utricular otoconia has been only poorly investigated on vital specimen. In this study, human otoconia were obtained from the utricle in five patients undergoing translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery. Specimens were examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy. Intact and degenerate otoconia as well as fracture particles of otoconia and bone were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Intact otoconia reveal a uniform size showing characteristic symmetry properties. Degenerative changes can be observed at several stages with gradual minor and major changes in their morphology including fragment formation. EDX analyses reveal the characteristic chemical composition also for otoconia remnants. XRD shows that intact and degenerate otoconia as well as remnants consist of the calcite modification. In conclusion, electron microscopy serves as a standard method for morphological investigations of otoconia. Human utricular otoconia show a uniform outer morphology corresponding to a calcite-based nanocomposite. Morphological changes provide further evidence for degeneration of utricular otoconia in humans, which might be a preconditioning factor causing BPPV.

In Quebec, an increase in the number of severe iGASd cases has recently been observed. Because of the inter-individual variability in the severity of iGASd, a hereditary predisposition to invasive disease can be suspected. Given that iGASd occurs in MyD88- and IRAK4-deficient patients, although rarely, the increasing frequency of iGASd in the population of French-Canadian children may be associated with a deficiency in the host’s innate immune response.

11997913,"With baby boomers entering old age and longevity increasing, policymakers have focused on the physical, social, and health needs of older persons. We urge policymakers to consider cognitive aging as well, particularly normal, age-related memory decline. Psychological scientists attribute memory decline mainly to cognitive overload stemming from age-related reductions in sensory capacities, speed of cognitive processing, and the ability to filter out irrelevant information. Even in the absence of decline, however, memory is imperfect and forgetting can be especially consequential for older adults.

16238404,"Nine volunteers aged 27 to 42 participated in an experiment with 370-day antiorthostatic hypokinesia at–5°C, and their blood serum samples were tested for the concentrations of lipid peroxidation (LPO) derivatives, including diene conjugates (DCs), malonic dialdehyde (MDA), and Schiff bases (SBs), and indices of the antioxidant defense system, including the tocopherol (TP) concentration and total antioxidant activity (AOA). The subjects were divided into two groups, which differed in physical training regimen and prophylaxis measures. Initial LPO steps were inhibited in both of the groups by 54–73% from day 50, while the level of SBs, which are final LPO products, decreased by 50–61% by day 230 and remained much the same up to the end of the experiment. The MDA and SB concentrations decreased by a factor of 1.6–2.3 during recovery. Total AOA decreased as an aftereffect during recovery to a level far lower than physiologically normal. Based on the significant inhibition of free-radical LPO throughout the experiment, long-term adaptation to simulated hypogravity was accompanied by a pronounced decrease in biological oxidation and caused severe stress. Substantial long-term readaptation stress developed during recovery after 370-day antiorthostatic hypokinesia, as was evident from the facts that the LPO activity was almost halved, TP concentration significantly increased, and the functional reserves of water-soluble antioxidants were exhausted. Lack of LPO activation was assumed to reflect adequate compensation in the subjects.",1,train,225
140961937,"The author shows that often quoted definitions used in the study of introductory courses in economics for the most part are lacking critical elements that would otherwise provide a more complete understanding of the nature of economic pursuits. The author uses the leading theories and methodology of the Austrian School of Economics to review and critique the definitional construct of the term ""Economics"" as it is commonly used in the literature. The author discusses important concepts central to the nature and understanding of economics as understood by the Austrians, such as: the importance of time preference, economics as a learning system, the importance of entrepreneurialism, value determination, scarcity, the fallacy of the concept of equilibrium, human action and Praxeology, the misapplication of the scientific method and scientism to economics as a social study along with a discussion concerning the relative application of econometrics to the field of study. In doing so he touches upon the classical foundations of Austrian School, being: Methodological Individualism and Methodological Subjectivism. The author finishes his review with a look at the Theory of Subjective Value, the Theory of Diminishing Marginal Utility, The Austrian Theory of Price and lastly with a review of the Austrian Theory of the Business Trade Cycle. Through this work the author introduces the reader to the most critical thinkers behind the Austrian School of Economics: Carl Menger, Eugen Bohn-Bawerk, Ludweg von Mises and his student F.

168260833,"In April 2016, a massive leak of confidential legal documents, now known as the “Panama Papers,” attracted international scrutiny and condemnation of offshore asset protection trust arrangements. Such trusts are legal to create but notoriously susceptible to abuse by wrongdoers seeking to hide assets from the peering eyes of tax collectors and creditors. The Panama Papers offer compelling evidence of something long suspected but difficult to prove for lack of transparency — even though asset-offshoring techniques may be used for legitimate purposes, they are, in fact, too often abused as a cover for criminal activity and tax evasion. In response to the leak, the U.S. Department of Justice and several foreign law enforcement agencies opened investigations into the financial improprieties uncovered by the Panama Papers. However, before criticizing offshore trust havens for capitalizing on fraudulent behavior at the expense of nonresident claimants, U.S. state lawmakers should first reflect upon the recent wave of domestic trust legislation authorizing similar conduct here at home.

One tactic for reducing peak loads is to increase the responsiveness of demand to changes in wholesale electricity prices.

We evaluate the effects of the CAHEM system on the larger power system, using PJM data from 1999, and then use the CAHEM system as the basis of a model of consumer response that we embed in a larger multi-agent simulation (MAS) of the electricity market. We focus on characteristics germane to the reliability of the transmission system, particularly price spike behavior and capacity availability and utilization.

We aimed to assess and compare geometric accuracy of preclinical scanners and examine the longitudinal stability of one scanner using a simple quality assurance (QA) protocol. Six 7 Tesla animal scanners across six different preclinical imaging centers throughout Europe were used to scan a small structural phantom and estimate linear scaling errors in all orthogonal directions and volumetric errors. Between-scanner imaging consisted of a standard sequence and each center’s preferred sequence for the assessment of infarct size in rat models of stroke. The standard sequence was also used to evaluate the drift in accuracy of the worst performing scanner over a period of six months following basic gradient calibration. Scaling and volumetric errors using the standard sequence were less variable than corresponding errors using different stroke sequences. The errors for one scanner, estimated using the standard sequence, were very high (above 4% scaling errors for each orthogonal direction, 18.73% volumetric error). Calibration of the gradient coils in this system reduced scaling errors to within ±1.0%; these remained stable during the subsequent 6-month assessment. In conclusion, despite decades of use in experimental studies, preclinical MRI still suffers from poor and variable geometric accuracy, influenced by the use of miscalibrated systems and various types of sequences for the same purpose. For effective pooling of data in multicenter studies, centers should adopt standardized procedures for system QA and in vivo imaging.",1,train,268

It traces the influence of particular individuals (e.g., Charles Clark in the United States, and Harry Woolf in England) in the use of empirical studies of litigation patterns and court rules to effectuate legal reforms. The essay reviews some particularly contentious issues over time, such as whether there is/was too much or too little litigation, access to courts, discovery practices, evaluations of the effects of particular rules, such as Rule 11 verification requirements, class actions, and practices such as court use of ADR, case management, and pre-trial conferences. The authors argue that empirical research on procedures and policies in courts have mostly been conducted in service of particular reform agendas, with a few exceptions of more ""pure academic"" study. The essay concludes with some suggestions for research questions that explore questions of who does the research for what purposes.

For the most part, this literature has found that users innovate but do not commercialize their innovations. Instead, users benefit from using their innovations and allow manufacturers to commercialize innovations with financial value. Yet scholars have recently shown that entrepreneurial activity by users is more widespread than previously believed. We present data and statistics documenting the prevalence, technological impact, and economic impact of user entrepreneurship. Then, to reconcile these divergent empirical findings, we develop a theoretical model that explains when user innovations are commercialized by users, by manufacturers, or not commercialized at all. At the core of our model is the notion that users and manufacturers differ along two critical dimensions: their estimates of the financial returns to entering the product market, and their profit thresholds. Depending upon the magnitude of these differences, we propose alternative commercialization outcomes. This model helps to explain why user entrepreneurs are likely to spawn the creation of altogether new product markets and even industries. We illustrate our model with examples from the field of consumer sporting goods.

Diet formulation employing a static linear programming (LP) approach, which is widely used in trading firms and feed production facilities, does not allow for intertemporal flexibility. Our approach allows the interaction between feed components over time, considering the volatile global feed prices, thereby improving sustainability in feed formulation and feed availability. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop a multi-stage LP feed model, (2) demonstrate its potential use in broiler feeding, and (3) illustrate the impact of feed input price spread (variation) on the composition of broiler diets. Modeling resulted in reciprocal relationships between conventional feeds and byproducts at different rates. Based on the price spreads expressed as a percentage of DDGS (distiller’s dried grains with solubles) price compared to corn price, three positions of dietary switch were identified; corn-DDGS price spreads of higher than 94%, between 76 and 94%, and lower than 76% corresponding to limited/no inclusion, partial inclusion, and maximum replacement of corn by DDGS, respectively. Rapeseed meal inclusion was 4, 5, and 6% in the corn-based starter, grower, and finisher diets, respectively, and its potential to replace soybean meal was limited by its higher fiber content.

41757242,"Nearly three-quarters of all newly diagnosed urothelial cancers are non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs). Although bladder-preserving surgery can be used to treat NMIBC, the rate of recurrence remains high. Intravesical chemotherapy has been shown to reduce the rate of NMIBC recurrence, and mitomycin C (MMC) has become the most commonly used intravesical cytotoxic agent. Despite the popularity of this agent in the treatment of NMIBCs, many questions regarding the optimal approach to MMC therapy remain unanswered. Strategies to enhance delivery of MMC have been well studied and multiple measures are recommended for implementation in routine clinical practice. In addition, less widely investigated techniques, such as hyperthermia and electromotive drug administration, have been shown to increase the efficacy of MMC therapy. Nevertheless, even when the current 'optimal' approaches to MMC administration are used, a large proportion of NMIBCs recur. This apparent treatment resistance might be overcome by combination of MMC with other agents that have different mechanisms of action and are unlikely to have cross-resistance. Study of the mechanisms of resistance is, therefore, important to identify key pathways underlying this phenomenon, which could be rationally targeted using specific combinations of drugs. Knowledge of these mechanisms might also reveal markers of responsiveness to therapy that could be used for patient selection.",1,train,208

8380952,"Investment volumes in renewable energies in Germany are far ahead of the necessary infrastructure to integrate them into both the electricity market and the grid. For storages and other technologies offering flexibilities the current regulatory framework and the market design in Germany remain a barrier for upcoming investments. In this paper regulatory barriers for an economically efficient energy storage deployment are presented and evaluated using a generic optimization model for a multifunctional operation of storage technologies on electricity markets capable to consider different market and regulatory design changes. Due to the rising significance of grid restrictions for the integration of intermittent resources and upcoming new innovative storage technologies on distribution grid level, the electricity grid was integrated into the model. Such an approach enables a quantitative analysis of interaction between market operation and grid congestion. This is shown using a 110kV high-voltage grid in the North of Germany as a representative congested grid with ongoing curtailments due to high wind energy penetration. Storage technologies — and also other measures as demand-side and generation management — will need a flexible market and a sophisticated regulatory design in order to significantly add value to the future energy system.",1,train,196

RRI has been promoted in the European Union as a part of the Europe 2020 strategy with the objective of making research and innovation more sustainable and inclusive. As more than half of the EU’s firms declare they are conducting innovation activities, RRI problems are more relevant than ever. There remain many open questions, unresolved dilemmas and empirical white spots that call for more research in this field. This paper’s focus is the problem of RRI acceptance as a global framework for responsible innovation and the scarcity of suitable instruments that may help industries understand and adopt this concept. The main contributions of this paper include critical analysis of the RRI concept and its implications for industry, proposing a concept of an RRI index for innovating enterprises.",1,train,164
16129476,"German law guaranteeing works councils is not a datum. The thrust of legislation has changed significantly on a number of occasions since 1920. The most recent legal change in the form of the Works Constitution Reform Act marks a controversial swing in favor of works council formation and authority. The present paper evaluates the new legislation from an economic perspective. We link the crucial terms of the new legislation to extant empirical evidence on the incidence of works councils, the availability of alternative employee involvement mechanisms, and the impact of the institution on performance by establishment size. Given the limitations of the evidence, which are shown to have relaxed the constraints on legislative innovation, we also offer some new empirical findings based on a matched-plants approach, using a nationally representative sample of establishments. This empirical strategy in principle offers improved estimates of the effects of works councils on establishment performance. Although the results of this exercise differ somewhat from earlier analyses, they provide little support for the recent legislative changes.",0,train,170

More precisely, the convergence of the model when the fixed costs tend to zero is investigated. A suitable limit model with purely proportional costs is introduced and an optimal strategy is shown to consist of keeping the risky fraction process in a unique interval $[A,B]\subseteq\,]0,1[$ with minimal effort. Furthermore, the convergence of optimal boundaries, asymptotic growth rates, and optimal risky fraction processes is rigorously proved. The results are based on an in-depth analysis of the convergence of the solutions to the corresponding HJB-equations.",0,train,105

166707232,"The green building market continues to grow, but so do the corresponding legal risks which are only now being explored by scholars and practitioners. Lurking in the shadows behind any green building risk management strategy is how consequential damages should be allocated among the project stakeholders and may emanate from a party's breach of a design, construction, or consulting contract. This allocation is particularly critical on green building projects, whose unique and novel nature can create an increased potential for consequential damages. For example, green building tax credits, premium rents, and even energy savings might fall within the definition of consequential damages, creating disproportionately large liability for parties that fail to protect themselves by contract.However, guidance from the courts on exactly what might constitute green building-related consequential damages is likely years away. Only one lawsuit to date provides any relevant insight, but its applicability is broad, particularly given the pace of green building regulatory activity that continues to take place at the state and local levels. After tracing the history of consequential damages and reviewing their potential sources on green building projects, this Article reviews how major industry organizations have treated the topic in form green building contract exhibits, and suggests general risk management strategies for different green building project stakeholders who allocate the risk of consequential damages in their contracts.",1,train,221
34075431,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been deeply implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, to keep a healthy mitochondrial population, a balanced mitochondrial turnover must be achieved. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in various neurodegenerative disease models; however, the mechanisms involved are still incompletely characterized. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of TUDCA against mitochondrial damage triggered by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophelyhydrazone (CCCP). Herein, we show that TUDCA significantly prevents CCCP-induced cell death, ROS generation, and mitochondrial damage. Our results indicate that the neuroprotective role of TUDCA in this cell model is mediated by parkin and depends on mitophagy. The demonstration that pharmacological up-regulation of mitophagy by TUDCA prevents neurodegeneration provides new insights for the use of TUDCA as a modulator of mitochondrial activity and turnover, with implications in neurodegenerative diseases.",1,train,135

We assume sector specific as well as aggregate ex- ternalities.

We show that under mild conditions, multiple equilibria occur. Indeed, following Grandmont, Pintus and de Vilder (JET, 1998), we can identify the necessary conditions for which the economic dynamics does change stability. In our framework, the capital utilization improves the imperfection in production sectors, resulted from the specific and aggre- gate externalities. We show that endogenous fluctuations are more likely to appear as long as the sensitivity of the capital utilization is su¢ ciently high with respect to the capital.

We complement our data with an assessment of cognitive and executive function skills. First, we find that adolescent girls display significantly greater risk aversion than adolescent boys. This pattern is not observed among young children, suggesting that the gender gap in risk preferences emerges in early adolescence. Second, we find that at all ages in our study, cognitive skills (specifically math ability) are positively associated with risk taking. Executive functions among children, and soft skills among adolescents, are negatively associated with risk taking. Third, we find that greater risk-tolerance is associated with higher likelihood of disciplinary referrals, which provides evidence that our task is equipped to measure a relevant behavioral outcome. For academics, our research provides a deeper understanding of the developmental origins of risk preferences and highlights the important role of cognitive and executive function skills to better understand the association between risk preferences and cognitive abilities over the studied age range.",1,train,170

154816582,"Summary A systematic calibration procedure is described for incorporating more than one risk model in a portfolio construction strategy. The addition of a second risk model can lead to just as conservative portfolios and better overall performance than one risk model alone provided that the strategy is calibrated so that both risk models affect the optimal portfolio solution. We report results using Axioma’s Japanese risk models and two risk constraints in the portfolio construction strategy. In all cases, Axioma’s daily fundamental factor Japanese risk model is the primary risk model which is used to define the tracking error of the portfolio, the primary risk constraint in the strategy. Three different second risk model constraints are considered: a) Constrain active risk using Axioma’s statistical factor risk model. b) Constrain total risk using Axioma’s statistical factor risk model. c) Constrain specific risk using Axioma’s fundamental factor risk model. Calibration of the portfolio construction parameters is essential since the region over which both risk models affect the solution is difficult to predict a priori and can be relatively narrow. In many cases, calibration results give a clear, optimum set of portfolio construction parameters in which the second risk model synergistically improves portfolio performance.",1,train,200

Methods: A retrospective interventional study was conducted reviewing our database for patients with a diagnosis of endophthalmitis in the course of anti-VEGF injections. Endophthalmitis diagnosis was made on clinical examination of pain, rapid decrease in visual acuity (VA), conjunctival hyperemia, hypopyon, and vitritis. In all eyes, core vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics was performed. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was performed monthly before and after surgery during follow-up. Anti-VEGF injections were continued after surgery in all cases. Results: Eight eyes with postinjection endophthalmitis were included. Mean VA immediately before endophthalmitis was 20/50 Snellen with a mean of 19 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (P = .45). At time of endophthalmitis diagnosis, mean VA was 20/1000 (range, 20/2000-20/200). Mean time from injection to when the patient noted first symptoms was 4.3 days (range, 1-8 days). Mean time from first symptoms to surgery was 12 hours (range, 2.5-26 hours). Final mean VA at the end of follow-up (range, 12-84 months) did not statistically differ from VA at the visit immediately before endophthalmitis diagnosis (P = .69). Mean frequency of injections after vitrectomy did not significantly differ from the presurgical course of treatment (P =.97).

24478484,"Introduction: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most important marker in the detection of prostate cancer, but its reliability is limited by a low specificity. To improve the specificity of PSA, a new parameter, based on the combination of free/total PSA (F/T) with PSA density, is proposed. Materials and Methods: From April 1999 to June 2003, a series of 647 men with high serum PSA levels were submitted to ultrasound-guided multiple prostate biopsies. Total PSA and free PSA were measured by immunoassay (DASIT, Italy). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of PSA density, F/T and (F/T)/PSA density (F/T divided by PSA/prostate volume) were constructed, and relative specificity and sensitivity were calculated. Results: Prostate cancer was present in 284 cases (137 of them with PSA values between 4 and 10 ng/ml), 31 patientshad intraepithelial neoplasia and the remaining cases showed benign prostatic hyperplasia. Analysis of ROC curves in all examined patients showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for (F/T)/PSA density (0.849) was significantly higher than the AUC for F/T (0.681) (p = 0.012). Similar results were observed in the cases with PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml, where the AUC for (F/T)/PSA density (0.768) was significantly higher than the AUC for F/T (0.610) (p = 0.041). In our study, the prostate cancer risk became very high when (F/T)/PSA density values decreased to <1.5. Conclusion: The use of the (F/T)/PSA density ratio may be useful in the detection of prostate cancer, reducing unnecessary prostate biopsies. A cutoff of 1.5 for the (F/T)/PSA density value is recommended for patients with PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml.",1,train,265

159218840,"This chapter describes practitioners’ understanding of excluding illegally obtained evidence. To gain deeper insight into the applicability of the exclusion of evidence obtained through illegal means and to evaluate regulations that have been implemented, fourteen experts from different legal professions (lawyers, judges, prosecutors) and countries (Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan (ROC)) were interviewed about their experiences. All legal systems are faced with the use of illegally obtained evidence. Based on qualitatively analyzed data the frequency of the applicability of exclusionary rules, the types of cases in which they are seen, and experts’ attitudes towards the function of exclusionary rules are described. Violations of rules around the gathering of evidence is a highly sensitive topic, particularly as the state (represented by police officers and prosecutors) plays a central and powerful role. To find out if exclusionary rules do indeed result in a more impartial trial or if further protective measures are required, factors influencing the procurement of evidence and the decision-making process around the legality of such procurement were evaluated. Subsequently, difficulties that law enforcement agencies and criminal courts are faced with were outlined, with an emphasis on the application of the law and the limitations in safeguarding criminal investigations and proceedings. Concluding remarks highlight best practices in securing a fair trial as well as ancillary measures (including unwritten techniques) that may be utilized to optimize the utility of exclusionary rules.",0,train,230

However, the idea remains controversial: some rail against the stereotype of the mad scientist or the crazy artist (e.g., Schlesinger, 2009, 2012), while others note higher incidences of mental illness amongst creative geniuses, including prize-winning authors, visual artists, and poets (e.g., Andreasen, 1987; Kaufman, 2000-2001; Nettle, 2006). Consistent with early ideas of a shared genetic basis (e.g., Lombroso, 1891; Galton, 1892), a growing body of research highlights a positive correlation between mental illness and heightened creativity (e.g., Rothenberg, 2001). The relationship between creativity and schizotypy warrants close examination, as greater creativity is associated with higher levels of schizotypal traits (e.g., Folley and Park, 2005). Atypical brain lateralization may play the causal role, being evident in people who are highly creative and in people who have high levels of schizotypal traits (e.g., Weinstein and Graves, 2002).

Can the metaphorical use of verbs, as in ""he hopped on his bike and flew home"" be recognized in the same way? We investigated whether the level of abstraction of a verb's referent provides a cue that the verb is used metaphorically rather than literally. We varied level of abstraction of verb use, and obtained judgments of metaphoricity as a function of abstraction level.

Results show that almost all the respondents have an intrinsic/integrative motivation orientation, a fact that has a noticeable positive effect on their classroom participation.

155574633,"This paper focuses on the current legal education reform dialogue. It argues that the dialogue fails to address the disproportionate exclusion of diverse students from the profession and the resultant lack of justice in underserved communities. The justice gap between impoverished and affluent communities in this country leaves the poor with inadequate legal representation. This gap is tied to the lack of diversity in the profession. Attorneys of color are more likely to serve clients of color and engage in public interest and public service practice. As the primary gatekeepers to the practice of law, law schools should address the disproportionate whiteness of the legal profession. If we reform legal education without reconsidering who law schools educate and who our graduates serve, we will have missed an opportunity to transform the academy and to make legal education and the legal profession more relevant and its practices more just.",0,train,148

21705113,"Abstract Global livestock production is going to be more and more sophisticated in order to improve efficiency needed to supply the rising demand for animal protein of a growing, more urban and affluent population. To cope with the rising public importance of sustainability is a big challenge for all animal farmers and more industrialized operations especially. Confined animal farming operations (CAFO) are seen very critical by many consumers with regard to their sustainability performance, however, the need to improve the sustainability performance especially in the ecological and social dimension exists at both ends of the intensity, i.e., also for the small holder and family owned animal farming models. As in livestock operations, feed and manure contribute the majority to the three most critical environmental impact categories global warming potential (GWP), acidification (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP) any effort for improvement should start there. Intelligent combination of nutrient-, emission- and waste management in an integrated low emission farm (LEF) concept not only significantly reduces the environmental footprint in the ecological dimension of sustainability, but by producing renewable energy (heat, electricity, biomethane) with animal manure as major feedstock in an anaerobic digester also the economic dimension can be improved. Model calculations using new software show the ecological improvement potential of low protein diets using more supplemented amino acids for the Chinese pig production. The ecological impact of producing biogas or upgraded biomethane, of further treatment of the digestate and producing defined fertilizers is discussed. Finally, the LEF concept allows the integration of an insect protein plant module which offers additional ecological and economical sustainability improvement potential in the future. Active stakeholder communication about implementation steps of LEF examples improves also the social aspect of sustainability.",1,train,283

Implications of the theory are evaluated using the multi-country ISSP94 household survey.

Changed from dilute HNO3 into a water medium by heating, REE ions are detectable at ∼2 ng mL-1. In the presence of coexisting elements from geological samples, REE separations were carried out. After sample fusion with Na2O2 and interference separation with ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate chelate, REE analytes were coprecipitated with Mg(OH)2 at pH 8.5, and then prepared into a water medium for CE determination. Using the standard addition method, this protocol was validated by analyses with better than 5% precision. This method was applied to geological materials; the REE results are in consistence with their certified values.

We describe a practical qualitative method, the narrative report, and its role in evaluating implementation research. METHODS We used narrative reports as a means to evaluate an intervention to integrate pharmacists into group family practices. The pharmacists submitted 63 written narrative reports during a 1-year period. Our interdisciplinary research team analyzed these reports to monitor the progress of the implementation, to identify pharmacists' needs, and to capture elements of the integration process. RESULTS The monthly narrative reports allowed the research team to document early learning and calibrate the program in terms of clinical support, adapting roles, and realigning expectations. The reports helped the research team stay in tune with practice-related implementation challenges, and the preliminary sum- mary of narrative fi ndings provided a forum for sharing innovations among the integrating pharmacists.

The optical load cell applied in ice monitoring systems is immune to electromagnetic interference and has no need of a power supply on site. Therefore, it has become a hot research topic in China and other countries. In this paper, to solve the problem of eccentric load in measurement, we adopt the shearing structure with additional grooves to improve the strain distribution and acquire good repeatability. Then, the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with a permanent weldable package are mounted onto the front/rear groove of the elastic element by spot welding, the direction deviation of FBGs is 90° from each other to achieve temperature compensation without an extra FBG. After that, protection parts are designed to guarantee high sensitivity for a light load condition and industrial safety under a heavy load up to 65 kN. The results of tension experiments indicate that the sensitivity and resolution of the load cell is 0.1285 pm/N and 7.782 N in the conventional measuring range (0–10 kN). Heavy load tension experiments prove that the protection structure works and the sensitivity and resolution are not changed after several high load (65 kN) cycles. In addition, the experiment shows that the resolution of the sensor is 87.79 N in the large load range, allowing the parameter to be used in heavy icing monitoring.",1,train,239

8197919,"An algorithm for recognizing banknotes is required in many fields, such as banknote-counting machines and automatic teller machines (ATM). Due to the size and cost limitations of banknote-counting machines and ATMs, the banknote image is usually captured by a one-dimensional (line) sensor instead of a conventional two-dimensional (area) sensor. Because the banknote image is captured by the line sensor while it is moved at fast speed through the rollers inside the banknote-counting machine or ATM, misalignment, geometric distortion, and non-uniform illumination of the captured images frequently occur, which degrades the banknote recognition accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose a new method for recognizing banknotes.

The method involves a pI-based fractionation using chromatofocusing in the first dimension followed by nonporous reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of each pI fraction in the second dimension. This allows fractionation of cellular proteins in the liquid phase that could then be arrayed on nitrocellulose slides and used to study humoral response in cancer. Protein microarrays have been used to identify potential serum biomarkers for prostate cancer. It is shown that specific fractions are immunoreactive against prostate cancer serum but not against serum from healthy individuals. These proteins could serve as sero-diagnostic markers for prostate cancer. Importantly, this method allows for use of post-translationally modified proteins as baits for detection of humoral response. Proteins eliciting an immune response are identified using the molecular mass and peptide sequence data obtained using mass spectrometric analysis of the liquid fractions.

Advocates for policies that would legalize marijuana recreational markets frequently argue that such laws will eliminate crime associated with the black markets, which many argue is the only link between marijuana use and crime. Law enforcement, however, has consistently argued that marijuana medical dispensaries (regulated retail sale and a common method of medical marijuana distribution), create crime in neighborhoods with these store-fronts. This study offers new insight into the question by exploiting newly collected longitudinal data on local marijuana ordinances within California and thoroughly examining the extent to which counties that permit dispensaries experience changes in violent, property and marijuana use crimes using difference-in-difference methods. The results suggest no relationship between county laws that legally permit dispensaries and reported violent crime. We find a negative and significant relationship between dispensary allowances and property crime rates, although event studies indicate these effects may be a result of pre-existing trends. These results are consistent with some recent studies suggesting that dispensaries help reduce crime by reducing vacant buildings and putting more security in these areas. We also find a positive association between dispensary allowances and DUI arrests, suggesting marijuana use increases in conjunction with impaired driving in counties that adopt these ordinances, but these results are also not corroborated by an event study analysis.",1,train,226

The instruments used were: 1) sociodemographic questionnaire to describe participants’ characteristics; the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale adapted for substance users to assess self-stigma; 3) MINI to confirm the substance dependence diagnosis. The sample was composed by 461 patients divided into three groups: 165 alcohol dependents, 141 crack dependents, and 155 crack and alcohol dependents. Most participants were male (91.4%), unemployed (68.6%), and single (70.5%), with incomplete elementary school education (53.3%), with a mean age of 35.38 years.

3521476,"A proper immune response ensures survival in a hostile environment and promotes longevity. Recent evidence indicates that innate immunity, beyond antimicrobial effectors, also relies on host-defensive mechanisms. The Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor SKN-1 regulates xenobiotic and oxidative stress responses and contributes to longevity, however, its role in immune defense is unknown. Here we show that SKN-1 is required for C. elegans pathogen resistance against both Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. Exposure to P. aeruginosa leads to SKN-1 accumulation in intestinal nuclei and transcriptional activation of two SKN-1 target genes, gcs-1 and gst-4. Both the Toll/IL-1 Receptor domain protein TIR-1 and the p38 MAPK PMK-1 are required for SKN-1 activation by PA14 exposure. We demonstrate an early onset of immunosenescence with a concomitant age-dependent decline in SKN-1-dependent target gene activation, and a requirement of SKN-1 to enhance pathogen resistance in response to longevity-promoting interventions, such as reduced insulin/IGF-like signaling and preconditioning H2O2 treatment. Finally, we find that wdr-23(RNAi)-mediated constitutive SKN-1 activation results in excessive transcription of target genes, confers oxidative stress tolerance, but impairs pathogen resistance. Our findings identify SKN-1 as a novel regulator of innate immunity, suggests its involvement in immunosenescence and provide an important crosstalk between pathogenic stress signaling and the xenobiotic/oxidative stress response.",0,train,208

26046496,"Alterations in the genome that lead to changes in DNA sequence copy number are characteristic features of solid tumors. We used CGH+SNP microarray and HPV-FISH techniques for detailed screening of copy number alterations (CNAs) in a cohort of 26 patients with cervical carcinoma (CC). This approach identified CNAs in 96.2% (25/26) of tumors. Array-CGH discovered CNAs in 73.1% (19/26) of samples, HPV-FISH experiments revealed CNAs in additional 23.1% (6/26) of samples. Common gains of genetic sequences were observed in 3q (50.0%), 1q (42.4%), 19q (23.1%), while losses were frequently found in 11q (30.8%), 4q (23.1%) and 13q (19.2%). Chromosomal regions involved in loss of heterozygosity were observed in 15.4% of samples in 8q21, 11q23, 14q21 and 18q12.2. Incidence of gain 3q was associated with HPV 16 and HPV 18 positive samples and simultaneous presence of gain 1q (P = 0.033). We did not found a correlation between incidence of CNAs identified by array-CGH and HPV strain infection and incidence of lymph node metastases. Subsequently, HPV-FISH was used for validation of array-CGH results in 23 patients for incidence of hTERC (3q26) and MYC (8q24) amplification. Using HPV-FISH, we found chromosomal lesions of hTERC in 87.0% and MYC in 65.2% of specimens. Our findings confirmed the important role of HPV infection and specific genomic alterations in the development of invasive cervical cancer. This study also indicates that CGH+SNP microarrays allow detecting genome-wide CNAs and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity more precisely, however, it may be less sensitive than FISH in samples with low level clonal CNAs.",1,train,253

To fill such a gap, an ad-hoc monitoring system of social capital was implemented along an actual participative procedure about the future of an University site. Results show that - i) social capital evolution can follow non-monotonic patterns; ii) different dynamics of social interaction may occur that impact the quality of participation; iii) different participatory tools may lead to different dynamics of social capital; iv) repeated measurements of social capital generate a memory effect which reduces the variation of social capital itself.

56480927,"Although abundant in organic molecules, carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bonds are typically considered unreactive and unavailable for chemical manipulation. Recent advances in C–H functionalization technology have begun to transform this logic, while emphasizing the importance of and challenges associated with selective alkylation at a sp3 carbon1,2. Here we describe iron-based catalysts for the enantio-, regio- and chemoselective intermolecular alkylation of sp3 C–H bonds through carbene C–H insertion. The catalysts, derived from a cytochrome P450 enzyme in which the native cysteine axial ligand has been substituted for serine (cytochrome P411), are fully genetically encoded and produced in bacteria, where they can be tuned by directed evolution for activity and selectivity. That these proteins activate iron, the most abundant transition metal, to perform this chemistry provides a desirable alternative to noble-metal catalysts, which have dominated the field of C–H functionalization1,2. The laboratory-evolved enzymes functionalize diverse substrates containing benzylic, allylic or α-amino C–H bonds with high turnover and excellent selectivity. Furthermore, they have enabled the development of concise routes to several natural products. The use of the native iron-haem cofactor of these enzymes to mediate sp3 C–H alkylation suggests that diverse haem proteins could serve as potential catalysts for this abiological transformation, and will facilitate the development of new enzymatic C–H functionalization reactions for applications in chemistry and synthetic biology.Evolved iron-containing enzymes based on cytochrome P450 achieve selective intermolecular alkylation of sp3 C–H bonds through a carbene C–H insertion strategy.",1,train,235

A genome-wide association study, based on 2,391,739 SNPs, was performed to identify SNPs that were significantly associated with gains in V'O2max and knee peak torque, following 9 weeks of the HIT program. To predict two training responses, two independent SNPs sets were determined using linear regression and iterative binary logistic regression analysis. False discovery rate analysis and permutation tests were performed to avoid false-positive findings. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: To predict gains in V'O2max, 7 SNPs were identified. These SNPs accounted for 26.0 % of the variance in the increment of V'O2max, and discriminated the subjects into three subgroups, non-responders, medium responders, and high responders, with prediction accuracy of 86.1 %. For the knee peak torque, 6 SNPs were identified, and accounted for 27.5 % of the variance in the increment of knee peak torque. The prediction accuracy discriminating the subjects into the three subgroups was estimated as 77.2 %. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Novel SNPs found in this study could explain, and predict inter-individual variability in gains of V'O2max, and knee peak torque.

The results not only fill the missing information on HPV infection in this group of women in the country, they also provide baseline data for a future evaluation of the impact of the Austrian gender-neutral HPV immunization program. Moreover, our finding of higher HPV prevalence in the eastern compared to the western district of the study region may – at least partly – explain the east–west gradient in the standardized incidence rate of cervical cancer in the region.",1,train,306
153588033,"For several decades, Northeast Asia has invested heavily in ASEAN’s fossil fuel industries. This investment has been fundamental in ASEAN’s industrial and regional development and has also been a main source of foreign exchange. In recent years, however, while energy demand in Japan and Korea has been slowing down, it has begun to increase rapidly in ASEAN at a time when some of its own oil and gas fields are beginning to decline. The sharp rise in ASEAN's demand for energy is partly the result of massive FDI from Northeast Asia in manufacturing enterprises. This investment is enabling ASEAN to become less dependent on the export of fossil fuels for foreign exchange. Indonesia has already announced it is reducing its energy exports to Japan because it wants to use the fuel domestically. Without doubt, the other ASEAN energy exporting countries will also soon be reconsidering their energy export contracts with Northeast Asia.",1,train,152
152878447,"In Dividing the Domestic, leading international scholars roll up their sleeves to investigate how culture and country characteristics permeate our households and our private lives. The book introduces novel frameworks for understanding why the household remains a bastion of traditional gender relations-even when employed full-time, women everywhere still do most of the work around the house, and poor women spend more time on housework than affluent women. Education systems, tax codes, labor laws, public polices, and cultural beliefs about motherhood and marriage all make a difference. Any accounting of ""who does what"" needs to consider the complicity of trade unions, state arrangements for children's schooling, and new cultural prescriptions for a happy marriage. With its cross-national perspective, this pioneering volume speaks not only to sociologists concerned with gender and family, but also to those interested in scholarship on states, public policy, culture, and social inequality.",0,train,145
27087530,"Job stress is vastly present in todayi¯s organizations, and the costs of these phenomena cut across all levels of society. In recent years, researchers considering job stress in the workplace have made great strides in understanding several aspects of the stress phenomenon in the field of organizational behavior. Thus, it becomes more important that the coping methods of these job stresses are well explored and directly linked to individuals experiencing this situation, in order to ensure the right methods can be used for the best benefits in coping with job stresses. This research presents an integration of past research and theory that models the relationship of antecedents of job stress and coping methods among managers. The scope of this case study is limited to managerial positions in electronics firms in Malaysia. A set of demographic factors like gender, marital status and educational background, are also studied as influencing factors to job stress. The final framework in this study includes the coping variables, in which will determine the best and most suitable coping methods for managers under job stress. A proportional sampling plan will be done to cover the surveys to be covering all major locations of electronics firms in Malaysia. Theoretical and managerial implications of the study will be discussed in details. The implication of the study would be extremely beneficial for electronics organizations in not only identifying the organizational sources of job stress, but also to understand the personality behaviors of their management staffs. More importantly, this study will recommend the best coping methods for managers that would enable the leadership team in the electronics organizations to be able to handle job stress more efficiently.",1,train,276

9400149,"After almost 50 years in science, I believe that there is an acceptable, often advantageous chasm between open-ended basic research-free exploration without a practical destination and in which the original ideas may fade into new concepts-and translational research or clinical research. My basic research on crystalline (proteins conferring the optical properties of the eye lens) led me down paths I never would have considered if I were conducting translational research. My investigations ranged from jellyfish to mice and resulted in the gene-sharing concept, which showed that the same protein can have distinct molecular functions depending upon its expression pattern and, conversely, that different proteins can serve similar functional roles. This essay portrays basic science as a creative narrative, comparable to literary and artistic endeavors. Preserving the autonomy of open-ended basic research and recognizing its artistic, narrative qualities will accelerate the development of innovative concepts, create a rich resource of information feeding translational research, and have a positive impact by attracting creative individuals to science.",0,train,164

Antibody drugs show several desirable characteristics, including good solubility and stability, long persistence in the body, high selectivity and specificity, and low risk for bioconversion to toxic metabolites. However, many antibody drugs demonstrate attributes that complicate drug development, including very poor oral bioavailability, incomplete absorption following intramuscular or subcutaneous administration, nonlinear distribution, and nonlinear elimination. In addition, antibody administration often leads to an endogenous antibody response, which may alter the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the therapeutic antibody. Antibodies have been developed for a wide range of disease conditions, with effects produced through a complex array of mechanisms.

It adopts the Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) by translating the remanufacturing operational process into a stochastic network. This stochastic network possesses two characteristics: activities having a probability of occurrence associated with them; and time to perform an activity. Together with the GERT method, Mason's rule is applied to calculate the equivalence transfer function of the system, therefore predicting the desired outcomes. A generic eight-step process on how to implement this method in any structure of return products and remanufacturing network is provided. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the result of using GERT on forecasting printer remanufacturing outcomes. The main contribution of this research is: Instead of giving one result such as either return quantity, or time, or probability, our research can forecast three of these outcomes simultaneously, and the algorithm is generalised to be applicable to any product structure and remanufacturing network.",1,train,167

This is set against a consideration of the development since the 1970s of a conservative politics championing de-regulation, unfettered markets, welfare cuts and harsh law and order policies. On the one hand, this led to massively increased inequality and concentrations of wealth and political power in the hands of the super-rich, effectively placing them above the law, as the GFC revealed. On the other, a greatly enlarged, more punitive criminal justice system was directed at poor and minority communities.

Data were collected through 58 interviews with stakeholders in charge of the policy; Ministers of Education and members of the Directorate of Education and Training in Norway, and the main actors such as municipality leaders, teachers, school leaders and students. Successful implementation of AfL processes was found in municipalities where there were dialogue and trust between the municipality level, school leaders, teachers and students and where the programme was adapted to the local context. Implementation was challenged when the policy was interpreted as a way of controlling the schools. Despite the successful implementation in some municipalities, the programme did not have any effect upon students’ learning outcome, as measured on national tests in reading and mathematics.

Supervisor ratings are subjective and data containing supervisor ratings typically stem from individual firm level data sets. For both these reasons, doubts persist on how useful such data are for evaluating theories in personnel economics and whether findings from such data generalize to the labor force at large. In this paper, we examine personnel data from six large companies and establish how subjective ratings, interpreted as ordinal rankings of employees within narrowly defined peer-groups, correlate with objective career outcomes. We find many similarities across firms in how subjective ratings correlate with earnings, base pay, bonuses, promotions, demotions, separations, quits and dismissals and cautiously propose these as empirical regularities.",1,train,122

The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)-IMRT versus the sequential boost (SEQ)-IMRT in HNC. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: A meta-analysis of 7 studies involving a total of 1049 patients was carried out to compare the treatment outcomes together with severe acute adverse effects of the SIB-IMRT versus the SEQ-IMRT in HNC patients. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Comparison of the SIB-IMRT and SEQ-IMRT showed no significant difference in the measurement of overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94; 95% confidence inerval [CI], 0.70-1.27; P = .71), progression free survival (PFS) (HR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82-1.30; P = .79), locoregional recurrence free survival (LRFS) (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65-1.47; P = .91), and distance metastasis free survival (DMFS) (HR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.50-1.53; P = .63). Moreover, there were no significant differences in adverse effect occurrence between the SIB-IMRT and SEQ-IMRT groups. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: SIB-IMRT and SEQ-IMRT can provide comparable outcomes in the treatment of patients afflicted by HNC. Both IMRT techniques were found to carry a similar risk of severe acute adverse effect. SIB-IMRT may have advantages due to its convenience and short-course of treatment; however, the optimum fractionation and prescribed dose remained unclear.

157251303,"Over the last two decades, farmers markets have been widely recognized for their contributions to local economies, support of small-scale farmers, and ability to reconnect consumers and producers of food. Farmers markets vary substantially in both the goals they set and the outcomes they achieve. By conducting a comparative analysis, this study examines whether and how market ownership influences outcomes. Additionally, our study focuses not on determining which ownership type is ""best,"" but on highlighting how markets differ, and more importantly, the limitations that need to be overcome for each type. The research uses Henry Hansmann's (1996) ownership of enterprise framework and Muhammad Yunus's (2010) social business framework to analyze whether differences in ownership lead to variations in market governance, conduct, and performance. Interviews were conducted with managers of Oregon farmers markets representing various ownership structures. Data were analyzed using the inductive thematic analysis approach to understand how ownership influences market goals and mission, general operations, and performance outcomes. The three major market ownership types, vendor-led, community-led, and subentities, have distinct benefits and challenges associated with them. Our findings indicate that vendor-led markets have strong ties back to their vendors but have weaker links to the communities that host the market and are less able to enhance the market by adding activities and pursuing additional fundraising. We found that community-led markets benefit from strong community ties and are often able to draw upon the energy and expertise of board members and volunteers. Their links back to producers depend on vendor representation on the governing body. Finally, markets that function as subentities of broader organizations have the potential for access to greater financial and managerial resources but are often relatively poorly linked to their vendors. These results provide useful insights both for those who are considering starting a market and for those who wish to improve the performance of existing markets.",1,train,310

There is good evidence that electroencephalographic (EEG) changes are common in children with autism and these EEG changes are considered to be signs of cerebral dysfunction. ::: Aim of the work ::: The aim of this study was to study specific EEG patterns in autism and to correlate severity of autism to EEG patterns. ::: Participants and methods ::: The study was conducted on 30 children who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for autism aged 3 years and above, and 30 siblings of them not fulfilling criteria of any pervasive developmental disorder. Participants of this study were recruited from the private centers of developmentally handicapped children, and the neuropsychiatry outpatient clinic of Alexandria University Hospital. All studied children were subjected to the following: first: full history taking and physical, neurological, and psychiatric examination for clinical assessment of ASD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Second: psychological testing using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Third: EEG for all sampled children. ::: Results ::: Prevalence of EEG abnormalities among autistic cases was 66.7%, whereas in the sibling group was 20%, which was significantly different from cases group. Generalized symmetrical spike wave complexes and focal centrotemporal spikes were the most prevalent EEG changes among autistic cases. There was a significant relationship between CARS and generalized EEG abnormalities. ::: Conclusion ::: Generalized symmetrical spike wave complexes and focal centrotemporal spikes were the most prevalent EEG changes among autistic cases. The lack of similarity between cases and sibling EEGs suggests that the epileptiform activity found in children with ASDs is more than just a familial pattern or a typical childhood finding. There was a significant relationship between CARS and generalized EEG abnormalities.",1,train,299

We find that the biological potential for further improvements in efficiency, and hence environmental impact reduction, is minimal relative to past progress already made via artificial selection. An alternative breeding strategy to produce slower-growing birds to meet new welfare standards increases environmental burdens, compared to current birds.

It can incentivize the buyers who have already joined in the auction to further diffuse the sale information to others via social relations, whereby both the seller's revenue and the social welfare can be improved. Diffusion auctions are essentially non-typical multidimensional mechanism design problems and agents' social relations are complicatedly involved with their bids. In such auctions, incentive-compatibility (IC) means it is best for every agent to honestly report her valuation and fully diffuse the sale information to all her neighbors. Existing work identified some specific mechanisms for diffusion auctions, while a general theory characterizing all incentive-compatible diffusion auctions is still missing. In this work, we identify a sufficient and necessary condition for all dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) diffusion auctions.

Since functional connectivity does not support inferences about causal brain connections, the changes in information flow in these distributed systems involved in smoking remain largely unknown. Here we apply a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) in resting state fMRI [2] to demonstrate the causal relationships among the core regions in smoking addiction. ::: ::: Healthy college students were recruited through campus advertisements. Among those who responded, there were 14 cigarette smokers and 14 nonsmokers. All data were collected using a 3-Telsa Siemens Skyra scanner. Functional data were processed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI, which is based on SPM (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit.

155365411,"Since climate change threatens human well-being across the globe and into the future, we require a concept of well-being that encompasses an equivalent ambit. This article argues that only a concept of human need can do the work required. It compares need theory with three alternative approaches. Preference satisfaction theory is criticised on the grounds of subjectivity, epistemic irrationality, endogenous and adaptive preferences, the limitlessness of wants, the absence of moral evaluation and the non-specificity of future preferences. The happiness approach is found equally wanting. The main section shows how these deficiencies can be addressed by a coherent theory of need. Human needs are necessary pre-conditions to avoid serious harm and are universalisable, objective, empirically grounded, non-substitutable and satiable. They are broader than ‘material’ needs since a need for personal autonomy figures in all theoretical accounts. Whilst needs are universal, need satisfiers are most often contextual and relative to institutions and cultures. The satiability and non-substitutability of needs is critical for understanding sustainability.

168793541,"The study attempts to define the dependence between how efficient insolvency proceedings are in particular countries (especially from the perspective of the yields for creditors from these proceedings) and the general level of development of the surveyed countries. This level of development is measured by the data of gross domestic product per inhabitant. The afore-mentioned data was selected on the basis of a hypothesis according to which the GDP per inhabitant in particular captures the ability of a given economic system to create wealth, whilst one of the fundamental prerequisites for such an ability is the general level of enforceability of a contract and therefore also the enforceability of a receivable. Insolvency proceedings as a formally demanding process based on legal specialties (usually an insolvency act) are a suitable representative of the requirement of enforceability of law. The yield for the creditor, then, is understood to be a crucial parameter of the insolvency system, for it is a natural gauge of the result of the enforcement process. Five groups of countries were formed for the purposes of comparison - the most developed European states, post-communist European states already included into the European Union, post-communist European states outside the EU, the most developed economies outside Europe and finally also oil-producing Arab states, where wealth is not necessarily proportional to the quality of enforceability of law. With the aid of regression analysis of the data, the work has proved that the quality of the legal environment measured by the efficiency of insolvency processes is truly related to the general efficiency of the economy. It is thus possible to assert on this foundation that, if we exclude states with exceptional mineral wealth, a high level of enforceability of law too is truly imperative in order to acquire wealth.",0,train,295
153687551,"Linear price systems, typically used to model “perfect” markets, are widely known not to accommodate most of the typical frictions featured in “actual” ones. Since some years, “proportional” frictions (taxes, bid-ask spreads, and so on) are modeled by means of sublinear price functionals, which proved to give a more “realistic” description. In this paper, we want to introduce two more classes of functionals, not yet widely used in Mathematical Finance, which provide a further improvement and an even closer adherence to actual markets, namely the class of granular functionals, obtained when the unit prices of traded assets are increasing w.r.t. the traded amount; and the class of star-shaped functionals, obtained when the average unit prices of traded assets are increasing w.r.t. the traded amount. A characterisation of such functionals, together with their relationships with arbitrages and other (more significant) market inefficiencies, is explored.",1,train,143

Recently, associations of elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations in the acute phase and of MTHFR 677 TT genotype with spontaneous cervical artery dissections (sCAD) have been reported. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis in the currently largest sample of patients with sCAD, taking into account known factors influencing plasma homocysteine levels. Ninety-five patients with past sCAD were compared with 95 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. Homocysteine, vitamin B6, B12, folate, and polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T), cystathionine β-synthase (CBS 844ins68bp) and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase/formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1 G1958A) were assessed and any associations were analysed using multivariate statistics. The occurrence of sCAD was associated with elevated homocysteine levels with an odds ratio of 1.327 per 20 % percentile. Homocysteine levels were influenced by gender, smoking status, occurrence of hypertension, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and by the MTHFR TT genotype. MTHFR, CBS 844ins68bp, and MTHFD1 G1958A genotype were not independently associated with the occurrence of sCAD.

Data sharing in research is widely discussed in the literature; however, there are seemingly no evidence-based incentives that promote data sharing. ::: ::: Methods: ::: A systematic review (registration: doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6PZ5E) of the health and medical research literature was used to uncover any evidence-based incentives, with pre- and post-empirical data that examined data sharing rates. We were also interested in quantifying and classifying the number of opinion pieces on the importance of incentives, the number observational studies that analysed data sharing rates and practices, and strategies aimed at increasing data sharing rates. ::: ::: Results: ::: Only one incentive (using open data badges) has been tested in health and medical research that examined data sharing rates. The number of opinion pieces (n = 85) out-weighed the number of article-testing strategies (n = 76), and the number of observational studies exceeded them both (n = 106). ::: ::: Conclusions: ::: Given that data is the foundation of evidence-based health and medical research, it is paradoxical that there is only one evidence-based incentive to promote data sharing.

Evaluation of these anatomic distances from 3rd and 5th lumbar vertebrae in both sides and in different body mass index (BMI) in healthy volunteers might improve knowledge of ultrasound (US) lumbar medial branch nerve blocks (LMBB). Methods: Bilateral US in the 3rd and 5th lumbar vertebrae of 64 volunteers carried out and the distance between skin to TP and skin to AP was measured. These distances were compared on both sides and in different BMI groups. The analysis was done using SPSS 11. Analysis of variance was used to compare the means at three vertebral levels (L3−L5) and different BMI groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The paired t-test was used to compare the mean distance between skin to TP and skin to AP on both sides. Results: The distance between skin to TP and skin to AP of 3rd vertebrae to 5th vertebrae was increased in both right and left sides (P ＜ 0.001) from up to down. The mean distance from skin to TP were greater on the left side compared to the right in all three vertebral levels from L3 to L5 (P values 0.014, 0.024, and 0.006 respectively). The mean distance from skin to TP and the skin to AP was statistically significant in different BMI groups (P ＜ 0.001).

The first stage of the estimation model involves a Probit analysis of the water reuse decision and the second stage employs an endogenous switching regression to estimate the intake water demand equations. Results suggest that water charges may act as an effective mechanism in inducing firms to undertake water reuse investments and in reducing intake water demand.

166821316,"""Contracting out placement services aims at enhancing the effectiveness of placements of unemployed job-seekers through market mechanisms. This paper analyses the effectiveness of the temporary assignment of needy job-seekers to private placement services by comparing their outcomes with respect to employment, unemployment and benefit receipt with those of a suitable control group. Using recently available administrative data we apply propensity score matching to construct the control group. We regard a period after a policy reform in 2005 that introduced a new means-tested benefit, the unemployment benefit II, and emphasized the activation of needy unemployed people. Hard-to-place job-seekers usually need more effort to be placed into a job. Therefore it is an interesting question whether groups of people with different a priori employment probabilities benefit to a different extent from an assignment to a private placement service. To answer this question we analyse several subgroups separated by sex, age, migration background, occupational education and time since the last job. Our results suggest that in some cases the assignment to private providers is relatively more effective for groups of job-seekers who are rather hard to place. Despite positive employment effects for some subgroups, however our results imply that the assignment to private providers is generally ineffective and in some subgroups counterproductive regarding the goal of avoiding unemployment and benefit receipt.""

Our results regarding a) show that Chinese learners of English acclimate to the target pattern of organizing particularly dense caused motion information very rapidly, and English learners of Chinese also arrived at an inter–language showing considerable resemblance to the target system rather than traces of the L1 influence. Our findings regarding b) reveal that despite striking differences between Chinese and English in L1 motion descriptions, native speakers show an identical tendency to prefer the path–match alternate over the manner– match alternate.

Using a convenient sample survey and a series of corporate stories we examine the options for turnaround strategies and the patterns of strategic choice. We find that economic recession provoked the 'return' of company owners to the role of 'internal strategists' or even into operations management. Under such conditions companies with dispersed ownership have visible disadvantages in building a consistent strategic agenda and timely implementation of robust strategies, as any strategic actions largely depend on a 'concert' of corporate strategists. Factor analysis of the actions implemented or planned for implementation reveals two patterns of strategic behaviour - cost leadership and differentiation. Cost leadership is the more popular option as it provides more chances for sustainability in the short term. The selection between the two strategic options is less determined by the company's past performance and competitiveness than by ambitions of key 'internal strategists'.",1,train,160
35649278,"Protons act as neuromodulators and produce significant effects on synaptic transmission. The molecular basis of neuromodulation by extracellular protons is partially explained by their effects on certain neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a family of eight receptor subtypes that are widely expressed throughout the mammalian CNS. In this study, the effects of physiologically relevant changes in extracellular pH were examined in mammalian cells expressing the mGluR subtypes: human mGluR1a, mGluR4a, mGluR5d or mGluR8b. The signal transduction coupling properties of mGluR4a and mGluR8b were switched from the adenylate cyclase (G(i)) pathway to the phospholipase C (G(q)) pathway by coexpression of a promiscuous G protein. Fluorometric imaging plate reader was used to measure changes in cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in response to agonist. Extracellular acidification from pH 8.0 to pH 6.5 progressively diminished mGluR4 responsiveness to the agonists L-glutamate and (2S,1'S,2'R)-2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine (L-CCG-I), and this inhibition was characterized by insurmountable antagonism. By comparison, extracellular acidification did not significantly alter mGluR8 responses to agonists. Furthermore, agonist activation of mGluR1a and mGluR5d was virtually unaffected by changes in pH. Because mGluR4 is expressed presynaptically and its activation inhibits the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA, we propose that the net effect of proton inhibition of mGluR4 would be to reverse or prevent that suppression of neurotransmitter release. As such, local decreases in pH could have significant effects on the regulation of transmitter release and synaptic tone via modulation of mGluR4.",1,train,242

This DEP system consists of mercury as a movable liquid electrode, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, SU-8-based microchannels for electrode passages, and a PDMS medium chamber. A simple squeezing method was introduced to build a thin PDMS layer at the bottom of the medium chamber to create a contactless DEP system. To determine the operating conditions, the DEP force and the friction force were analytically compared for a single cell.

157539113,"Abstract Theatre and law are not so different. Generally, researchers work on the art of theatre, the rhetoric of the actors, or the dramaturgy built from law cases or from the questions that the law does not completely resolve. Trials, tragedies, even comedies are close: everybody can see the interpenetration of them on stage and in the courts. We know that, and we know that the dramas are made with/from/of law, we know that the art the actors are developing is not so far from the art of the lawyers, and conversely. In this paper, I would like to have a look at the action of the audience, at the session itself and at the way the spectators are here to evaluate and judge not only the dramatic action, not only the art of the actors, not only the text of the author, but also the other spectators, and themselves too. In particular, I will focus on the “common judgment” of the audience and on its judicial, aesthetic and social relationship. The spectators have been undisciplined, noisy, unruled, during such a long period that theatre still retains some prints of this behaviour, even if nowadays, the social and aesthetic rule is to be silent. But uncertainty, inattention, distraction, contradiction, heterogeneity are the notions which characterise the session, and the judgments of the spectators still depend on them. So, what was and what is the voice of the audience? And with what sort of voice do spectators give their judgments?",0,train,249

The EEG is acquired using BIOPAC Student Lab with suitably placed silver/silver chloride electrodes to study the effects of Alpha music on Alpha and Beta rhythms of the subjects EEG. Research shows Alpha waves are predominantly observed in healthy relaxed individuals. Since anxiety and stress are major emotional contents of human beings, the goal of this experiment is to assess the means of relaxation and concentration using Alpha music, which influence the alpha and beta rhythms significantly. For each subject, three EEG recordings were taken. One before the alpha music stimulus, one after 6 minutes of Alpha music and the last towards the end of alpha music. There was an increase in the maximum amplitudes of Alpha waves either after 6 minutes or after 12 minutes of alpha music. However, the maximum amplitude of beta waves showed a decline of up to 40% from the initial value. The standard deviation of both Alpha and Beta waves are almost stable between the mid and final recording. These results, namely, the increase in Alpha activity and decrease in Beta activity indicate that subjects experience ‘relaxed alertness’.

201323647,"Abstract. This paper illustrates the relationship between energy reforms and economic sustainable development in Egypt and Iran; through analyzing the relation between energy reform and four main macroeconomic variables, namely: budget deficit, energy consumption, inflation and economic growth. The methodology adopted in this paper is a comparative case study between Egypt and Iran, using qualitative descriptive analysis; focusing on the period from 2010 to 2014, as this period is characterized with active subsidy reform efforts for both countries. The paper concludes that reforming energy subsidies generally tends to relief the strain on the public budget, in case it is not accompanied with simultaneous economic difficulties which can deem the reform efforts obsolete, like in the case of Iran. In addition, the responsiveness of energy consumption of a certain fuel to the increase in its price is heavily reliant on its price elasticity of demand. This is represented in the availability of alternative energy sources. Moreover, the effect of the reforms on inflation is normally instantaneous and short-lived and could be mitigated through government intervention; that was clear in the case of Egypt. However, Iran did not show a similar trend as there was a weak correlation between subsidy reforms and inflation. Finally, there tends to be a very weak relationship between subsidy reforms and GDP growth, implying that the effect of other economic factors outweighs that of subsidy reforms. Keywords.

146452954,"This article aims to extract from the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a basic theory of legal effects of unilateral instruments of international organizations in public international law. These effects can be divided into three categories. The first is substantive effects. These include binding, authorizing and (dis)empowering effects. The second category is causative effects, which are the triggering effects that determinations of fact or of law have on substantive effects by bringing them into existence. The third category is modal effects – how and when the substantive effects come into existence (e.g. immediate or deferred, retroactive or non-retroactive, reversible or irreversible effect). Each of these categories of legal effects behaves differently according to whether the effects are intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic effects are based on the special treaty powers of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly. In this hypothesis, all three categories of effects exist to the full extent that the explicit and implicit powers of the adopting body allow for them. Extrinsic effects are directly based on general international law, in particular on the rules of formation of customary international law. Here, there are no causative effects. Substantive effects do not strictly speaking exist; only pre-substantive ones do. And modal effects are always immediate, non-retroactive.",0,train,210

We characterized this new biosensor in motile mouse embryonic fibroblasts and observed robust activation dynamics at leading edge protrusions, similar to those previously observed for endogenous Cdc42 using the organic dye-based biosensor system. We then extended our validations and observations of Cdc42 activity to macrophages, and show that this new biosensor is able to detect differential activation patterns during phagocytosis and cytokine stimulation.

It was found that down regulation of APAF1, a putative tumor suppressor gene (TSG), leads to resistance to chemotherapy and disease development in some cancers. In this study, we investigated the relation of APAF1 methylation status with its expression and clinicopathological factors in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Materials andMethods: Methylation Sensitive-High Resolution Melting Curve Analysis (MS-HRM) was employed in studying the methylation of CpG islands in the APAF1promoter region in MDS. Gene expression was analyzed by using real time RT-PCR. Results: 42.6% of patient samples were methylated in promoter region of APAF1analyzed, while methylation of the gene was not seen in controls (P<0.05). Methylation of APAF1was significantly associated with the suppression of its mRNA expression (P=0.00). The methylation status of APAF1in advanced-stage MDS patients (80%) was significantly higher than that of the early-stage MDS patients (28.2%) (P=0.001).

3746820,"The increased concern about environmental problems caused by inadequate waste management, as well as the concern about global warming, promotes actions toward a sustainable management of the organic fraction of the waste. Landfills, the most common means to dispose of municipal solid waste (MSW), lead to the conversion of the organic waste to biogas, containing about 50% methane, a very active greenhouse gas (GHG). One unit of methane has a global warming potential of 21 computed for a 100-year horizon or 56 computed for 20 years. The waste sector in Israel contributes 13% of total greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions for a time horizon of 100 years (for a time horizon of 20 years, the waste sector contribution equals to more than 25% of total GHG emissions). The ultimate goal is to minimize the amount of methane (CH4) by converting it to CO2. This can be achieved by physicochemical means (e.g., landfill gas flare, incineration) or by biological processes (e.g., composting, anaerobic digestion). Since the waste in Israel has a high organic material content, it was found that the most cost-effective means to treat the degradable organic components is by aerobic composting (investment of less than US$ 10 to reduce emission of one ton CO2 equivalent per year). Another benefit of this technology is the ability to implement it within a short period. The suggested approach, which should be implemented especially in developing countries, could reduce a significant amount of GHG at relatively low cost and short time. The development of a national policy for proper waste treatment can be a significant means to abate GHG emissions in the short term, enabling a gain in time to develop other means for the long run. In addition, the use of CO2 quotas will credit the waste sector and will promote profitable proper waste management.",1,train,302

We characterize the optimal rebates contracts and returns contracts.

Although one might conjecture that returns would be inferior because its provision of “insurance” would discourage the retailer from forecasting, we show that returns are superior.",1,train,158
29554851,"German energy policy targets envision a share of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) of at least 80% in 2050. How can the transformation of the German electricity sector be achieved and at what costs? This paper addresses these questions by means of a meta-analysis of 10 recent model-based mitigation scenarios for Germany. It turns out that the scenarios exploit the three basic strategic options of increasing the share of RES-E – domestic RES-E generation, electricity demand reductions, and RES-E imports – to substantially different extents. Domestic RES-E generation increases in all scenarios, particularly from onshore and offshore wind. Scenarios that rely heavily on reducing electricity demand require a relatively low expansion of domestic RES-E generation. Despite detailed technical analyses, insights on the costs of the transformation remain limited. A discussion of underlying scenario assumptions reveals that it is unclear whether (i) RES-E and system integration technology development will be as cost-competitive as postulated, (ii) implicitly assumed institutional requirements will be realized, and (iii) relevant actors in the transformation process will be incentivized accordingly. Therefore, future research should pursue a thorough assessment of strategic options for transforming the German electricity system that consistently integrates technologies, institutions, and actors.",1,train,198

We find that becoming self-employed is indeed associated with a relative increase in risk attitudes, an increase that is quantitatively large and significant even after controlling for individual characteristics, different employment status, and duration of entrepreneurship.

The classic myopic labor supply model (in which only the current wage matters) is rejected in favor of one that includes forward-looking considerations, embodied in returns to experience.

The revoke of CR-CW in Law 27/2007 is caused that the concept of concession is contrary to the norms of natural resources management in the 1945 Constitution and the spirit of people empowerment. The new concept offered in the Decision is the common access. In this concept of access, CA-SI is regarded as the common property with the rules from members of the community itself. The provisions to access CA-SI as the common property are also determined by agreements of the community itself. Management of CA-SI on the common access is in accordance with people empowerment. The consistency is shown by the relevancy of concept of common access to include three key issues of people empowerment (access, assets and collective capabilities).",0,train,232
35352351,"Public officials have recently sought increased regulation of financial disclosures from not-for-profit organizations as a means of improving accountability with the public. One objective of this study is to examine whether not-for-profit entities already subject to audit requirements submit financial reports in compliance with GAAP. Further, since the majority of not-for-profit organizations are not subject to public audit mandates, this study also ascertains whether other market actors such as donors monitor and demand accrual-based financial information. The empirical analyses indicate that not-for-profit organizations subject to public audit mandates are largely in compliance with GAAP, although a significant minority of organizations subject to state requirements is not; further analyses suggest that external oversight significantly influence the use of accrual reporting. Models are also tested on a subsample of not-for-profits that switched from cash to accrual reporting, with the results suggesting that increasing public and market oversight have a significant effect on the decision to switch methods. The overall results suggest that public and market actors demand accrual-based financial reporting from not-for-profit organizations.",0,train,171
154758127,"The UK Supreme Court will eventually have to pass judgment on the compliance of the legal and policy framework for ‘criminality information sharing’ with the stipulations of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and perhaps in relation to more than one area of practice within public protection work. Parliament should recognise that there is a groundswell of judicial (and academic) opinion which suggests that, if the current legal framework regulating the sharing of information for the purposes of public protection is lawful, even in the face of criticism from the European Court of Human Rights, then an intolerable level of uncertainty as to the issue of that legality has now been reached. This paper addresses the root causes of this legal uncertainty, and argues for statutory reform to revisit even recent tinkering with the law in this area. In an overview of both a body of common law, in the form of a series of key decisions from the courts, as well as the tensions between two tracts of legislation, promoting public protection and human rights values occasionally at odds with one another, this piece examines the crucial issue of the retention of criminality information and the idea of individual (offender) consultation over its use in public protection work.",1,train,212

We propose a theoretical model showing that welfare policies follow the median voter constituency regardless of whether governments are center-left or center-right in the majority electoral system, whereas large differences exist between center-left and center- right coalitions in the proportional representation system. We exploit these differences in the mechanisms of welfare expenditure to estimate their elasticities on income inequality and find that a 1% increase in government spending reduces the Gini income index by half a percentage point. This result is robust under different compositions of expenditure, alternative imputation model specifications and falsification tests.",1,train,106
151213657,"One of the most recent waves of reform in public education began in 1989 when the governors and legislators identified eight goals for the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (U. S. Department of Education, 1994). This legislation promulgated the need for standards-based education and impacted health education in several ways. First, it urged the establishment of “safe, disciplined, and alcohol and drugfree schools” that would provide students with the environment conducive to learning and required that schools provide drug and alcohol education as part of a comprehensive health education curriculum (U. S. Department of Education, 1994, p. 3). Secondly, this legislation encouraged the development of “outcomes” or standards that defined what K-12 students should know and be able to do. In fact, one objective of goal three specified that “all students have access to physical education and health education to ensure they are healthy and fit” (p. 1). Student standards for health education were published in 1995 in the National Health Education Standards (Joint Committee on National Health Education Standards, 1995). These seven standards provide performance-based criteria required for meeting specific levels of health education knowledge and skills in elementary, middle-level, and secondary grades. Thirdly, Goals 2000 specifically addressed teacher education and professional development, so that teachers could “acquire the knowledge and skills needed to prepare students for the next century” (U. S. Department of Education, 1994, p. 2). In other words, standards for teachers in all subject areas including health education were needed to specifically determine the competencies for professional development to be demonstrated.",0,train,255

This finding has a very strong implication for the effectiveness of fiscal policies that change the allocation of resources between generations. We build a two-sided altruistic-linkage model in which private transfers are made in the presence of two types of shocks: an “observable” shock that is public information (for example, a public redistribution like debt or pay-as-you-go social security) and an “unobservable” shock that is private information (for example, individual wage innovations). Parents and children observe each other’s total income but not each other’s effort level. In the second-best solution, unobservable shocks are only partially shared, whereas, for any utility function satisfying a condition derived herein, observable shocks are fully shared. The model, therefore, can generate the low degree of risk sharing found in previous empirical studies, but REH still holds.",0,train,159

This paper outlines and assesses the arguments used to justify current prices. Rather than structural factors (such as population growth and housing supply) being the main elements supporting current house prices, the alternative view is that cyclical factors, essentially low interest rates and low unemployment, are the key factors currently keeping Australian house prices at their present levels. Analysis of the housing market from an investor's perspective also suggests that very optimistic assumptions of future house price growth and/or future rental growth are being factored into current market pricing. The strong economic conditions in Australia, reflected in the low unemployment rate, should protect the Australian housing market from a US-style housing collapse in the short term, but in the longer term increasing unemployment will inevitably cause some correction in house prices.",1,train,153

The body of the article is comprised of five sections. Following a brief introduction I begin by examining al-Ṭahṭāwī's justifications for the mission's pursuit of sciences in Paris. These work to communicate a compatibility between Islamic precedent and learning sciences abroad. The next section moves to consider whether and how the ‘Franks’ sciences’ connect to their Christianity. I then focus on how al-Ṭahṭāwī categorically portrays those sciences the mission seeks to learn, which he refers to as ʿulūm ḥikmiyya, before turning to concentrate on his presentation of the universal structure of transmitted (naqliyya) and rational (ʿaqliyya) sciences. Together, these two sections show how al-Ṭahṭāwī incorporates and assimilates the Franks' sciences into an Islamic model, restricting these sciences as partial while easing and advocating for their integration into the Islamic lands. The fifth and final section looks more closely at how al-Ṭahṭāwī describes the universal sciences of language alongside the singularity of Arabic in order to draw attention to consequences of al-Ṭahṭāwī's efforts to translate across French and Arabic. In closing I offer a few remarks about how and why al-Ṭahṭāwī frames the Franks' sciences as he does, and suggest how the assimilation of their sciences impacts the greater Islamic structure that absorbs them.",0,train,235

Really, it is a story about students trying to seize kairos, the opportune moment in time to effectuate change. Seeing an opportune moment in time to call attention to a legal issue they identified as important, the three third-year law students in this story wrote, as amici curiae, a brief in support of a petition for certification to the New Jersey Supreme Court on the issue of whether indigent litigants in civil domestic violence cases have the right to court-appointed attorneys. These students and their professors believed the timing was right to argue that indigent litigants involved in the New Jersey domestic violence restraining order process have a legal right to court-appointed counsel as a requirement of equal access to a fair trial. The issue had been briefly raised several years earlier. However, the right to counsel issue had been completely disregarded by the courts, and no state-based advocacy groups pursued the issue. These students, in contrast, saw something to the issue that other advocates had missed. Moreover, they saw it at the right time in their own legal education to act on it, compellingly.

Self-sufficient types derive utility simply from their own consumption and do not compare themselves with others. I derive a condition under which the utility (happiness) of both types increases when the economy is populated by a larger share of competitive types. In the long-run the condition is always fulfilled when the economy is capable of economic growth. The reason for this phenomenon is that competitive types generate higher savings and thus higher aggregate capital stock and income per capita, which raises utility of both types. I show that the result is robust to the consideration of endogenous work effort and that a sufficiently high share of competitive types in a society can be inevitable for long-run economic growth to exist.",0,train,146

Illicit drug use among young people has risen steadily over the past 30 years in the UK and beyond (Miller and Plant, 2001). Illegal drugs now account for 8 per cent of global trade and represents the third largest industry in the world after oil and arms. Young (2002) estimates the illicit drug trade has an annual turnover of 100 billion dollars, making it the world’s largest rogue industry against which few effective levers or sanctions exist. ::: ::: Trends in illicit drug use have changed in recent years as the number of people using drugs rose steadily throughout the twentieth century particularly amongst young people in the last two decades (Measham et al, 1998; Hibbell et al, 1997). The literature has traditionally focused upon the cause of drug use behaviour from the perspective of the individual, examining factors such as: family life, school life, friendship networks and the areas in which they live. This paper looks beyond these individual factors through an examination of the value of the social exclusion discourse which offers a more holistic approach to our understanding of adolescent drug use behaviours. Such an approach provides the opportunity to understand adolescent drug use from a perspective that presents a more all-encompassing view of the lives of drug-using young people.

This paper attempts to explain this apparent difference. In particular it will be shown that environmental policies,here investigated for pollution charges,call for a modification of incentives such that the power of optimal incentives is reduced to which workers will respond with less effort. This friction,which may add up to significant numbers for the economy at large,is neglected in both the theoretical literature and in the application of CGE-models.

The rapid commercialization of the press, together with an increase in literacy and political consciousness, has led to swift growth in the newspaper market but also changed the way news makers mediate politics. Positioned at a historical junction where India is clearly feeling the effects of market liberalization, this study demonstrates how journalists and informants interactively create new forms of political action and consciousness. The book explores English and Hindi newsmaking and investigates the creation of news relations during the production process and how they affect political images and leadership traditions. It moves beyond the news-room to outline the role of journalists in urban society, the social lives of news texts and the way citizens bring their ideas and desires to bear on the news discourse. This important volume contributes to an emerging debate about the impact of the media on Indian society. Furthermore, it convincingly demonstrates the inseparable link between media related practices and dynamic cultural repertoires.

We estimate that differences between male and female peer groups explain approximately half of the gender gap in early career entrepreneurship.",0,train,100

Supported by the social network analysis theory and method, we take the listed companies network embedded in the strategic emerging industries as an example, and use negative binomial regression to study the impact of network embeddedness on firm innovation capability. The empirical results show the firms embedded in alliance networks with better betweenness centrality will have greater innovative output in one or two years later; the liner relationship between the whole network density and the innovation ability is not obvious, but has a significant inverted U type effect, in other words, the firms embedded in alliance network with moderately dense connection will have greater innovative output.

31959800,"Many observers have begun to question the U.S. reliance on an employ- ment-based private health insurance system. In thinking about the future of this sys- tem, it is instructive to examine the German experience. The German health insurance system is almost entirely organized and financed around the labor market. In recent years, the German labor market has changed in several ways. Among other changes, more German women now work, the proportion of retirees in the population has increased, the share of manufacturing in employment has declined, and the economy has become more open. These labor market changes have made it more difficult to organize health insurance around employment in Germany. Recent changes in the Ger- man health insurance system have, to some extent, decoupled health insurance from employment. This decoupling is likely to continue as the labor market changes further. We explore the implications of this experience for the United States.",1,train,151
157770168,"Selection of “the problem” of neo-regionalisation for study directly deals with its importance as a determining factor of many developments in the arena of international relations. Its importance appears especially when it is manifested as a theoretical approach, as an analytical category and as a new practice of economic and political organisation in the regional level and in the same way in the international aspect as well. Although studiers concede that the world is going towards larger units of integration in global level, however, regionalisation (neo- regionalisation) is becoming a new identity for people in the 21 st century. This is valid especially for the European societies and states aiming to be part of the supranational structures of the European Union. In relation to this, the study below is focused on new integrating practices in Europe, which is known as “Neo-regionalism” in order to see how this new practice is influencing in intensifying the regional cooperation. To make the study even more concrete, a concentration in case study has been made in regional cooperation within CEFTA with a particular focus in its implications towards Kosovo and vice versa. The theses will also be discussed whether Kosovo has benefited or lost from this cooperation to review the possibilities of continuing further cooperation or to quit it. Undoubtedly, the establishments presented above may be used for reaching a concrete conclusion for the results of this cooperation, what is going to serve as a platform for drawing some recommendations for further coordination of actions for cooperation in the regional plan.",1,train,257
145420740,"This article offers a sympathetic appraisal of Erich Fromm’s conceptualisation of narcissism as it relates to the emergence, sustenance, and resolution of authoritarian violence. The discussion is first placed within the methodological debate over the analytic operations that are required for an adequate understanding of authoritarian violence, explaining why a psychoanalytic perspective is necessary. The focus then shifts to Fromm’s take on the Freudian concept of narcissism, before proceeding to explore in some depth his account of the symbolic mechanisms and contextual climate that must combine in practice in order for narcissistic energies to be channeled into authoritarianism and violence. Attention in this regard is paid both to the populace and governing elites. The article concludes with a short exposition of Fromm’s notion of benign narcissism, from its specific content to the conditions of its possibility. Cet article offre une evaluation bien disposee de la conceptualisation du narcissisme selon Erich Fromm et du rapport de cette notion a l’emergence, la nourriture et la resolution de la violence autoritaire.

19920037,"Abstract When a fish stock shifts from one nation to another nation, e.g., due to climate change, the nation that loses the resource has incentives to deplete it, while the other nation, receiving the resource, has incentives to conserve it. We propose an analytical model to study under which circumstances self-enforcing agreements can align incentives. Our setup allows to distinguish between a fast and a slow shift and between a smooth or a sudden shift in ownership. We show that the shorter the expected duration of the transition, the higher the total equilibrium exploitation rate. Similarly, a sudden shift implies—by and large—more aggressive non-cooperative exploitation than a gradual shift. However, a self-enforcing agreement without side-payments is more likely for a sudden than for a smooth shift. Further, the scope for cooperation increases with the expected duration of the transition, and it decreases with the renewability of the resource and the discount rate. Most importantly, we show that concentrating on in-kind transfers can be very detrimental for shifting renewable resources: In some cases, there is no efficient bargaining solution without side-payments, even when there are only two players.",0,train,187

In particular, it sought to focus on the transfer of innovation in continuing university education, with particular emphasis on the development and delivery of online higher education courses throughout rural Iceland (i.e., outside of Reykjavik). The partners concentrated on how knowledge and experience about distributed and distance learning models could be transferred between the partner countries and how such models can be integrated into the education system to better support higher education and lifelong learning.

In this article, we examined the effects of a contact intervention containing narratives of moral exemplars on reconciliation processes in the postgenocide setting of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Results from our 2 studies showed significant positive changes after the contact interventions that highlighted and focused on documented stories of individuals (moral exemplars) saving the lives of their adversaries. We found that focusing on moral exemplars increased reconciliatory beliefs due to enhanced forgiveness.

Lamfalussy pursued a threefold career: as a private banker, a central banker and an academic. Partly under the influence of Robert Triffin, Lamfalussy soon became interested in international monetary issues. This paper analyses his views on the international monetary system and on European monetary integration, including his contributions to the Delors Report, which provided the framework for European monetary union. The paper draws extensively on archival research in the Lamfalussy papers at the Bank for International Settlements and the minutes of the EEC Committee of Governors' meetings.

Investment in outside options is a prime example of such opportunism and often leads to inefficiency, for example by exerting effort to search for alternative business partners even if it does not add trade value. We experimentally investigate a bilateral trade relationship in which standard theory assuming self-regarding preferences predicts that the seller will be better off by investing in the outside option to improve his bargaining position. The seller’s investment, however, might negatively affect the buyer’s other-regarding preferences if the investment is viewed as opportunistic. We find overall support for our hypotheses that arise from the link between other-regarding behavior and opportunism. Our findings suggest that when the transaction cost economics approach is applied to the design of a governance structure, other regarding preferences, if relevant, should be taken into account.",0,train,150

From these eleven common terms, a trader has to choose the Incoterm that is most appropriate for the specific transaction he wishes to engage in. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) encourages the use of ‘multimodal’ terms (FCA, CPT, CIP, etc.) instead of the ‘maritime’ Incoterms (FAS, FOB, CFR and CIF). According to the ICC, maritime terms are not appropriate, and thus should not be used in container trade, as the seller does not ‘deliver’ the container on board the vessel, but most often hands over the goods to the carrier at an inland point or terminal.

Successful use would occur through a continuous interplay between users’ technology mental models and their organisational setting and work practices. When in contradiction with the latter, users would not consider the system and hence its use could fade away.

Helping cooperators to mix assortatively is believed to reinforce the rewards accruing to mutual cooperation while simultaneously excluding defectors. However, the relationship between endogenous partner selection, assortativity, and cooperation has been largely unexplored experimentally. Here we report on a series of human subjects experiments in which groups of 24 participants played a multi-player prisoner's dilemma game where, critically, they were also allowed to propose and delete links to players of their own choosing at some variable rate. Over a wide variety of parameter settings and initial conditions, we found that endogenous partner selection significantly increased the level of cooperation, the average payoffs to players, and the assortativity between cooperators. Even relatively slow update rates were sufficient to produce large effects resulting in cooperation levels over 80%. Subsequent increases to the update rate still had a positive, although smaller, effect. For standard prisoner's dilemma payoffs, we also found that assortativity resulted predominantly from cooperators avoiding defectors, not by severing ties with defecting partners, and that cooperation correspondingly suffered. Finally, by modifying the payoffs to satisfy two novel conditions, we found that cooperators did punish defectors by severing ties, leading to levels of cooperation approaching 100% which persisted for longer.",1,train,226

Undoubtedly; this to a large extent has emboldened the economic profile of the country, especially in the 1970’s when it was described as a boom. It was this high economic pedestal that propelled the country to become an important continental player even in the West African sub-region. More important is the emergence of a nouveaux riche whose claim to affluence is traceable to emphatic link with the oil and gas industry. Regrettably, the region where this wealth is derived is wallowing in ash-mouthed poverty. As the Sir Henry Willink Commission of 1958 declared, it is ‘backward, neglected and poor’. Majority of the people that inhabit the place are not only existing below the bread line level, but denied of lifesaving amenities.

106399842,"Dynamic microsimulation modeling involves two stages: estimation and forecasting. Unobserved heterogeneity is often considered in estimation, but not in forecasting, beyond trivial cases. Non-trivial cases involve individuals that enter the simulation with a history of previous outcomes. We show that the simple solutions of attributing to these individuals a null effect or a random draw from the estimated unconditional distributions lead to biased forecasts, which are often worse than those obtained neglecting unobserved heterogeneity altogether. We then present a first implementation of the Rank method, a new algorithm for attributing the individual effects to the simulation sample which greatly simplifies those already known in the literature. Out-of-sample validation of our model shows that correctly imputing unobserved heterogeneity significantly improves the quality of the forecasts.",0,train,124

While recent work has focused on how to model risk in Markov decision processes using risk measures, it has not addressed the problem of solving large risk-averse formulations. In this paper, we propose and analyze a new method for solving large risk-averse MDPs with hybrid continuous-discrete state spaces and continuous action spaces. The proposed method iteratively improves a bound on the value function using a linearity structure of the MDP. We demonstrate the utility and properties of the method on a portfolio optimization problem.",0,train,91

13286123,"The aim of this research is to propose a model that relates information technology (IT) investments, supply chain governance (SCG) and performance together. For this purpose, a pilot study involving both a qualitative and a quantitative stage was conducted. The qualitative analysis, consisting of an extensive literature review and two case studies conducted in six major, globally-relevant Brazilian companies, led to the development of an initial model. This model was refined during the quantitative stage that involved 38 executives from large national companies. IT was found to be one of the main drivers of SCG influencing companies' supply chain performance. The final model consists of 5 constructs and 26 elements. Regarding the SCG constructs: (a) a new element 'formal contracts', emerged in the 'contractual SCG' construct; (b) the element 'cooperation' was not confirmed in the 'relational SCG' construct; (c) the element 'transparency' was considered an important element in the 'transactional SCG' construct. Five new elements emerged in the 'IT investment' construct. Market aspects were highlighted as being relevant in the 'supply chain performance' construct. Thus, the model includes elements that can be analyzed in order to shed light on how IT investments influence SCG and supply chain performance.",1,train,198

149859398,"In this manuscript, I build and expand on prior work by myself (Nowakowski, 2016) and others exploring the dynamics of embodiment among people with chronic health conditions. Specifically, I critically investigate the intersecting social and medical elements of responses to bodies perceived as too thin and otherwise lacking in physical ability, using my own experiences of living and aging with cystic fibrosis (CF) as a case example. In these explorations, I center gendered identity and its intersection with disabling physical illness. I do so by using my own lived experiences as autoethnographic anchor points to guide critical review of key concepts from the nexus of these two content areas. I focus throughout on exploring how others’ reactions to a frail-looking body often constitute a form of forced gendering via the narratives people attempt to construct for why a person’s body appears that way. The title of the manuscript supports this framework by referencing three cornerstones of patient experience in the CF community: the general trend of patients having salty skin due to the pathology of the disease, a prior embodiment project called Salty Girls (Pettigrew, 2012) that engages this idea, and the more abstract concept of “saltiness” in describing the grit marginalized people display in responding to microaggressions.",0,train,208

The expansion of protected groups and the dismantling of the more overt forms of exclusions has strained the antidiscrimination norm embodied by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As the law expanded the class of protected workers, its redistributive aims grew more pronounced. This chapter of a forthcoming handbook on the economic foundations of labor and employment law and provides an overview of this shift, focusing on the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. With each further expansion of the reach of employment discrimination laws, the relation between bias and what may be termed employers’ economically rational discrimination became a more significant part of the case law. This chapter addresses some of the underlying labor economic issues as civil rights laws confront accommodation requirements and redistributive aims.

19015794,"With about 30% increase over three months, Facebook has become a major online venue among Arabic young generation. However the understanding of its adoption as well as the cultural influence remains in its infancy. In recent study, Srite and Karahanna (2006) examined the cultural impact at the individual level and, built upon Hofstede’s framework, conceptualize it as espoused national cultural values, which were proposed to moderating the effects of TAM variables, i.e., perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and subjective norms, on IT acceptance. Although insightful, the conceptualization of espoused national cultural values and its impacts requires further validation with subjects from different cultural backgrounds and IT artifacts which may be more subject to cultural influences, e.g., social networking sites. Therefore, this study is aimed to validate and extend the work by Srite and Karahanna (2006) by examining the role of espoused national cultural values in Facebook adoption among Arabic female college students. Considering the cultural differences, we extended the original cultural dimensions in (Srite and Karahanna 2006) to incorporate long-term orientation and also explicate the dimension of collectivism/individualism along two directions, e.g., horizontal vs. vertical. Different from the IT artifacts (PC and PDA) examined in (Srite & Karahanna, 2006), the IT artifact examined in this study is Facebook and its usage may be subject to more cultural influences than using PC and/or PDA, since Facebook involves a lot of social interaction and socialization. A survey study with 200 college female students in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of UAE was conducted to validate the research model. 127 students returned the valid responses. At the moment of data collection, all respondents were new users of Facebook. Data collection involved two stages. The first stage was to collect the response for TAM variables and espoused national cultural values; while the second one, after one week, was for Facebook adoption. Smart PLS was used for data analysis. We expect that the results not only provide further empirical validation of Srite & Karahanna’s theory (2006) with Arabic sample, but also extend the original research by demonstrating complete range of cultural dimensions. Currently, we are in the stage of finalizing data analysis results. By the time of the conference, we shall be able to provide the complete results.",1,train,374

Thus, we argue that the syntactic status of the oblique subject-like NPs has not changed at all from object status to subject status, contra standard claims in the literature. Our evidence stems from Old Icelandic, but the analysis has implications for the other old Germanic languages as well. However, a change from non-canonical to canonical subject case marking (‘Nominative Sickness’) has affected all the Germanic languages to a varying degree. (Less)",0,train,136

It mines a rich vein of work sustained at Cambridge over many years. Contributors to this work have included Jean Rudduck, Michael Fielding, Donald McIntyre, John MacBeath and Madeleine Arnot. The modes of participation considered include student voice or consultation, students as researchers, participative pedagogy and student leadership. These resonate with the values of the Leadership for Learning (LfL) endeavour (MacBeath & Dempster, 2009) in which shared leadership is a cornerstone. This article explores the relationship between the key concepts of learning, participation and democracy. It draws its analysis from a series of key projects initiated under the umbrella of LfL in Cambridge in recent years, including the „Influence and Participation of Young People in their Learning‟ project (MacBeath et al., 2008), the „Evaluation of the Learning to Lead Initiative‟ project (Frost & MacBeath, 2010) and the „Student Leadership for School Improvement‟ project (Roberts & Nash, 2010).

In addition, many scholars have called for an examination of differences in public service motivation across levels of government, such as Pandey and Stazyk (2008). This paper answers this call by focusing on variances in prosocial behavior across levels of government employment to determine if federal, state or local government workers tend to have higher levels of altruism than workers in other levels of government.

Natural Gas in Asia is a new edition of a 2002 study on the future of natural gas in the major energy markets of Asia. The 2nd edition has been substantially rewritten and completely updated, and contains two new chapters on South East Asia, Australia, and the Middle East. The future energy needs and environmental problems of China, India and the rest of Asia are considerable. A major question is whether gas supplies can and will respond to expanding demand for the cleanest fossil fuel? Large scale projects will need to be implemented in Russia, the Central Asian Republics and the Middle East to bring required supplies to Asian markets in the years to 2020. This book assesses the economic opportunities, political obstacles and other challenges - both domestic and international - to these projects. In order to succeed, pipeline infrastructure will need to be built over long distances to bring gas to these markets, as well as significant numbers of new LNG terminals. The volume discusses the major current and potential gas markets in Asia: China, India, Japan and Korea, as well as the potential supply of pipeline gas and LNG to Asia from: Russia, Central Asia, South East Asia, Australia and Middle Eastern countries. An important aspect of the next two decades will be the extent to which the region can develop pipeline gas sources to supplement existing large scale LNG imports. The volume also looks at the substantial gas markets emerging in China and India which are at the early stage of introducing large scale natural gas use in cities. These markets face the commercial challenge of developing gas-fired power generation at a cost which may be greater than generation based on domestically produced coal. However, considerations of local air quality and global emissions may give extra value to gas fired generation, as has happened elsewhere in the world.

Despite its diverse emphasis on materialist, idealist and institutionalist factors, the demographic approach can be criticized for neglecting the interdisciplinary challenge behind the phenomenon. Instead, these approaches operate on the basis of an “equation model of society” that essentially attempts gradually to enhance the illumination of the black box that “contains” the passage of young women to adulthood, leaving them with fewer children born at a later age.

The present study determined the association between serum NGAL and iron status in chronic kidney disease with anemia. A total of 154 adult CKD patients were divided into anemia and without anemia groups. The anemia groups were further subdivided into two groups based on the presence or absence of iron deficiency, defined as a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. The NGAL was measured for all the 154 patients, and the possible relationships with iron status were analyzed. 27.7% patients with TSAT < 20% presented lower hemoglobin, serum iron, serum ferritin, and higher NGAL values than those without iron deficiency. NGAL was inversely correlated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, serum iron, and TSAT. NGAL adequately diagnosed the status of iron deficiency among CKD patients by ROC analysis. The optimal NGAL cutoff value able to identify iron deficiency was found to be > 244.8 ng/mL, with 73.01% sensitivity and 68.29% specificity. CKD patients with anemia presented altered NGAL values as this protein is involved in the maintenance of iron balance.

The results indicate that: (1) buyers’ CSR performance has a significant and positive effect on long-term M&A performance. (2) Significant differences exist across geographical regions in the links between CSR and long-term M&A performance. In our study, the effects of CSR on long-term M&A performance were positive and significant in a sub-sample of firms located in the eastern region, but the effects were negative and insignificant in a sub-sample of firms located in regions other than in the east. (3) Related-party M&A transactions experience more positive and significant CSR long-term M&A performance linkage, compared to non-related party M&A transactions. Our findings might provide more robust evidence to CSR performance linkage, as we have examined the linkage in a special context of M&A activities, using a Heckman two-stage model to alleviate endogeneity bias. We also bring further insights into the effects of two contingent factors (geographical regions and related-party transactions) on the CSR-performance linkage.

The hidden characteristics are emission intensity and outside option, assumed perfectly correlated, so that the firm has a type-dependent reservation utility. There is mixed ownership to the firm; a fraction is owned by foreigners whose welfare does not enter the home government’s objective function. The home government has a limited set of policy instruments; in fact only net emissions can be taxed. The familiar trade-off between efficiency and rent extraction will involve over-pollution, with (possibly) a subset of the most emission-intensive firm types being induced to relocate. This effect is reinforced by increased foreign ownership, as the cost of leaving rent then increases. (Ownership has no real impact under complete information.)

The system includes an interceptor for intercepting datastreams from a computer network intended for an application program; a scanner for scanning the intercepted datastream for trigger events, such as cookie data, script commands, and applet programs; and an event response generator for processing detected trigger events. Configuration data is used to identify a response for trigger events such as disabling script commands or programs and deleting or modifying cookie data. The event indicators and an action menu are generated by the event response generator and delivered with the processed datastream to the application program. The application program displays the event indicators so the user is made aware of the trigger events and the action menu allows a user to respond to the detected trigger events. In the preferred implementation, the user may respond by obtaining information about the site which transmitted the datastream having the trigger events and then send e-mail to the administrator of the site. Other actions include modifying the configuration data so subsequent datastreams with the trigger event is passed by the system. Outbound messages from the application program are also intercepted and scanned for trigger events. In the preferred implementation, the configuration data are exchanged between the system and the application program so the user may modify the operation of the system. The configuration data are deleted from the outbound datastream before it is transmitted in the preferred implementation.

33407849,"We examine trends since 1980 in material extraction in China, India, Indonesia, and Japan—which together contain over 40% of the world’s population—to assess the environmental consequences of modernization. Economic and population growth has driven rapid expansion of material extraction in China, India, and Indonesia since 1980. China and India exhibit patterns consistent with the Jevons paradox, where the economic intensity of extraction (extraction/GDP) has steadily declined while total extraction grew. In Indonesia, extraction intensity grew along with total extraction. In Japan, total extraction remained roughly constant, increasing somewhat in the 1980s and then slowly declining after 1990, while extraction intensity declined throughout the entire period. These different patterns can be understood to some degree by drawing on political-economic and world-systems perspectives. Japan is an affluent, core nation that can afford to import materials from other nations, thereby avoiding escalation of material extraction within its borders. China and India are rapidly industrializing nations that, although increasingly drawing on resources from beyond their borders, still rely on their own natural resources for growth. Indonesia, an extraction economy with less global power than the other nations examined here, exports its own natural resources, often unprocessed, to spur economic growth. The trends highlighted here suggest that in order to avert environmental crisis, alternative forms of development, which do not involve traditional economic growth, may need to be adopted by nations around the world.",1,train,229

40443198,"Although the adoption of renewable energy is perceived as a means to enable delivery of emission-free solutions, its penetration into the energy market has not been timely and significant enough to make a material impact on the structure of the global energy system. Using backcasting as a policy tool for developing a view of a sustainable energy future, this Chapter aims to explore some of the critical hurdles as the policy makers continue to formulate and advance environmentally friendly energy consumption in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change. We illustrate the nature of the challenges to reach a wider adoption of alternative energy resources and build on the need for renewal of the energy “delivery” infrastructure through the “smart grid” as a means for transition to a sustainable economy in the longer term. While there is now engagement with the public about a sustainable future, alignment of stakeholders’ economic interests and absorption capacity of emerging technologies remain as the two main challenges in mitigating the underlying systemic hurdles to be overcome. As the public at large realize the need for a future of sustainable energy despite lack of a global consensus about definitive targets, the policy makers may seek to provide a combination of approaches that build on optimal investment incentives in the near-term, liberalization of the electricity grids in the medium term and a dynamic policy framework that induce continuous technological innovation in the longer term. Observing the current responses to the externalities by the policymakers in a number of jurisdictions we articulate such forthcoming initiatives to mitigate the systemic hurdles embedded in the existing energy infrastructure. We also articulate measures to enable deployment of integrative sustainable energy solutions over a transformed infrastructure, namely smart grid.",0,train,289
151996728,"Previous discussions of the Frankfurt School’s work on Judeophobia have almost entirely neglected the Critical Theorists’ pathbreaking analysis of “secondary antisemitism” after Auschwitz. This new form of Jew-hatred originates in the political and psychological desire to split off, repress, and downplay the memory of the Holocaust because such memory, with which Jews are often identified, evokes unwelcome guilt feelings. As Holocaust memory undermines the uncritical identification with a collective, family, or nation tainted by anti-Jewish mass atrocities, the repression of national guilt may unconsciously motivate the reproduction of resentments that helped cause the Shoah. In this light, the article re-examines the empirical postwar German study Group Experiment and other works of the Frankfurt School. Three specific defensive mechanisms in relation to historical collective guilt feelings are identified that engender a variety of antisemitic projections—from “Jewish power” to “Jewish money” and other anti-Jewish tropes—after the Holocaust. It is argued that these insights into post-Holocaust secondary antisemitism, empirically analyzed in the German context, can partly be transferred to other contexts in European democracies and beyond. This article demonstrates that an unprocessed history of national guilt can have a negative impact on democracy and the resilience of antisemitism.",1,train,195

We estimate a vector autoregession to examine the joint behavior of returns, cash-flow news, and trading between individuals and institutions. Our main finding is that institutions buy shares from individuals in response to good cash-flow news, thus exploiting the underreaction phenomenon. Institutions are not simply following price momentum strategies: When price goes up in the absence of positive cash-flow news, institutions sell shares to individuals. Although institutions are trading in the 'right' direction, institutions as a group outperform individuals by only 1.44 percent per annum before transaction and other costs, because they are extremely conservative in deviating from the value-weight market index.",0,train,138

The proposed model and hypotheses, based on the conformance and performance roles of boards, are tested on a rich sample that includes all banking firms operating in Costa Rica between 2000 and 2012. The results indicate that the negative effect of non-performing loans on ROA is significantly greater in banks with non-performing directorship associated with high rates of unexpected changes in the board. The findings of the study highlight that the competence of boards matters.

Using electric pacemaker is the most common treatment for the patients with heart conduction problems. The present study aimed to determine the factors affecting survival in the patients undergoing pacemaker implantation in the hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to identify the factors affecting the survival of the patients suffering from arrhythmia. Patients and Methods: This retrospective survival analysis was conducted on all 1207 patients with heart failure who had undergone permanent pacemaker implantation in the hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from 2002 to 2012. The data were analyzed using non-parametric methods such as Kaplan-Meier method, life table, and Cox regression model. The risk factors of mortality were determined using multivariate Cox proportional hazards method. Results: Survival data were available for 1030 (80%) patients (median age = 71 years [5th to 95th percentile range: 26 - 86 years]) and followup was completed for 84.28% of them. According to the results, 56% of the patients had received dual-chamber systems, while 44% had been implanted by single-chamber ventricular systems.

Second, it aims at contributing to a more general methodological discussion about agent-based models by proposing an econometric analysis of the results of the simulations. The case of the pharmaceutical industry has been studied extensively by scholars because, despite the high level of R&D intensity, the industry has been characterized by a relatively low levels of concentration. The model is able to reproduce the main stylized facts of the industry in an evolutionary perspective. In this paper we extend the analysis conducted in two previous works (Garavaglia et al. 2012, 2013) by further qualifying the findings with an extensive econometric investigation of the model outputs. The paper focuses the attention on the determinants of market structure, the innovative performance of the industry, the diversification in multiple submarkets and the level of prices. We find that the properties of the technological and demand regimes are key determinants of the patterns of industry evolution and that the main mechanisms driving the model are the random processes of search, the discovery of new submarkets as well as the interactions between patent protection, imitation and price competition. In addition, this paper emphasizes how the emerging leaders in the industry are those innovative early entrants which entered in large submarkets, showing the importance of the first mover advantage and of the size of the “prize” accruing to innovators when they discover a new rich submarket.",1,train,253

However, the MTH process possesses a C 1 -entity reactant and cannot, therefore, shed any light on the homologation reaction sequence. The reaction and deactivation mechanism of the zeolite H-ZSM-5-catalyzed ETH process was elucidated using a combination of complementary solid-state NMR and operando UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, coupled with on-line mass spectrometry. This approach establishes the existence of a homologation reaction sequence through analysis of the pattern of the identified reactive and deactivated species. Furthermore, and in contrast to the MTH process, the deficiency of any olefinic-hydrocarbon pool species (that is, the olefin cycle) during the ETH process is also noted.",1,train,142

The key model propositions are further exemplified by a sensitivity analysis using plausible ranges of parameter values for India. We also provide empirical evidence using data on twenty-seven Indian States (including one Union Territory) between 1989 and 2010 on informal wages, capital stocks in informal and formal zones and value-additions in the formal segment to substantiate the model prediction on informal wage depicted in our numerical exercise, which shows that the growth in informal wage could reasonably be linked to the productivity surge in the formal sectors, while greater capital accumulation in the informal units over the formal counterparts has further aggravated this upswing in informal wages.",1,train,230

We make use of all pre-treatment CD4 counts, because analyses using only a single observation at initiation may be subject to biases. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We used data from the CASCADE (Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe) multinational cohort collaboration of HIV-1 seroconverters. We analysed pre- and post-treatment data of patients with seroconversion dates estimated January 2003-March 2014 (n = 7600 for primary analysis) using a statistical model in which the characteristics of recovery in CD4 counts are determined by multiple predictive factors. Secondary analyses were performed incorporating uncertainty in the exact timing of seroconversion to allow more precise estimation of the benefit of very early treatment initiation. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: 'True' CD4 count at cART initiation was the strongest predictor of CD4 count beyond 3 years on cART. Allowing for lack of complete certainty in the date of seroconversion, CD4 recovery was more rapid for patients in whom treatment was initiated within 4 months. For a given CD4 count, higher viral load (VL) at initiation was strongly associated with higher post-treatment CD4 recovery. For other patient and drug characteristics, associations with recovery were statistically significant but small in magnitude. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: CD4 count at cART initiation is the most important factor in predicting post-treatment recovery, but VL provides substantial additional information.

156296326,"Following the beginning of the financial crises in 2008, the Federal Reserve introduced a number of new monetary policy tools. It was aimed at supporting the functioning of financial markets during the crisis and helping the economy recover from the recession by altering both the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. These new policy tools came as a last resort when traditional policy tool, such as, the federal funds rate target was already constrained near zero. This new policy tool – called “quantitative easing” – is comprised of (a) lending to financial institutions, (b) providing liquidity to key markets, and (c) purchasing longer-term securities. While the first two were aimed at lowering the short-term lending rates, the third one was aimed at lowering the long-term lending rates. Lowering of the lending rates was expected to raise consumer and business spending and, thereby, stimulate the economy. There have been studies on the effect of this new policy tool on various aspects of domestic and international economies. However, none has evaluated the policy’s effect on U.S. balance of trade. Our study develops a model of the balance of trade, which is a function of domestic (U.S.) and foreign real GDPs, exchange rate of U.S. dollar, and monetary policy (credit easing) dummy. We then empirically test the model on a panel data for the U.S. and BRICS countries over the period, 1995 – 2014, and find that the Fed’s quantitative easing has no effect, whatsoever, on U.S. balance of trade. This finding although seems counterintuitive but is logical. This is because, the BRICS countries’ economic growth is mainly export driven. Therefore, a rise (fall) in their GDP means a rise (fall) in their exports, that is a rise (fall) in U.S. imports from these countries causing a fall (rise) in U.S. balance of trade. This negative effect of BRICS countries’ real GDP on U.S. balance of trade was offset by the positive effect of lowered value of the U.S. dollar – caused by the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing – leaving the U.S. balance of trade unaffected.",0,train,346

55178212,"To sustain its knowledge economic growth, Malaysian government had launched the K-Economy Master Plan in 2010; outlining the knowledge economy policy initiatives in supporting the knowledge based economy. The transition to knowledge based-economy, knowledge plays a governing role in leading the productivity and maintaining the economic performance growth. Equally important would be the factors that would contribute towards the knowledge creation. However, the literature indicates that very little attempts have been conducted to investigate factors that influence knowledge productivity. In Malaysia, the Administrative and Diplomatic Officers or PTD, are heavily involved in the development and implementation of the main policy makers of the federal government. However as to date, there are no mentions of any study exploring knowledge productivity of PTD. Against this background, this study intends to investigate the contributions of job characteristics towards knowledge productivity. In the process, it will propose a framework linking job characteristics and knowledge productivity. The proposed research method that will be employed will be a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The qualitative approach will use interview as the main data collection technique, while the quantitative approach will adopt the questionnaire. The qualitative approach will help the researcher to develop the framework that depicts the factors that contribute towards knowledge productivity among PTD. Based on this framework a questionnaire will be developed so as to collect quantitative data involving PTDs. The contribution of the study can be viewed from two perspectives i.e. theoretical and practical. From the theoretical perspective, the study will develop an empirical based framework while from the practical perspective the study will help to devise strategies for improving and enhancing knowledge productivity. The significant of the study is that, it will further improve knowledge productivity among PTDs who are mainly involved in executing the country's development strategies including strengthening the administrative functions, social infrastructures and also the performance of the country's economic growth in line with the country's National Key Results Area (NKRA).",1,train,323

As a result, they seek to implement proper strategies to maximize capacity and competitiveness. This article asks whether a multinational company in medical devices has the strategic potential to transform its procurement strategy to embrace a local sourcing concept to gain competitiveness while retaining engineering origin. Study results from the medical-device industry show that attributes delivered by German origin can improve competitiveness. A significant majority of customers see the importance in the “Made in Germany” label. Customers also tend to accept the conception of local production that retains German engineering. The medical-device industry represents several branches in areas such as quality and technology. The results of this paper address product marketing, product strategy, and decision-makers dealing with sourcing alternatives. The results suggest that the strategy of pairing local production with German engineering is desirable to enhance competitiveness.",1,train,152

However, problems arise when the notion of right differs from one culture to another. The question addressed in this paper is whether the moral reasoning abilities of Australian and Malaysian accounting students in their final year of study differ because of their cultural upbringing. This study uses primary data collected from 34 final year accounting students (12 Australian and 22 Malaysian) enrolled in an Australian degree program. The test scores collected at the beginning and end of the academic year indicate that culture and other explanatory variables do not have an affect on students' moral judgment.

While the effects on labor force participation of EITC have been thoroughly studied, producing a consensus that the program encourages participation particularly among single women with children, the effect on hours has taken a back seat in most studies. Those who have studied the issue have generally found no effect. A number of those studies, however, were based on a population defined too broadly to indicate anything meaningful for the EITC population, while others seemed to overlook facets of their own data. I include a multiple regression using Current Population Survey Data cases in which family income corresponds to the phase-out range of EITC. Only in the phase-out range â€“ as beneficiaries lose part of their benefits as a percentage of income above the threshold amount â€“ would we expect a negative effect on hours worked. My results show a small negative effect on hours worked for the population in the phase-out range.",1,train,179

To date, the UN has not developed a comprehensive mechanism to investigate and punish such violations. In order to comply with IHL and to uphold the UN’s mission of promoting international cooperation, the UN must establish a clear framework to enforce the law of war within its own peacekeeping and peace enforcement forces. This article will begin with an introduction to UN peace operations, highlighting some cases of alleged abuse. The second section will examine the applicability of IHL to the UN. First, the section will examine the nuances of IHL by describing the differences between international, non-international, and internationalized armed conflict. It will then demonstrate that the UN is bound by IHL. The article will conclude by examining several potential mechanisms to enforce the UN’s obligations under IHL: international state responsibility; domestic proceedings in the troop-contributing state; human rights mechanisms; claims commissions; the International Criminal Court (ICC); and ombudspersons.

It is attracting increasing interest for the production of biopharmaceuticals, due to its capability of performing posttranslational modifications. Traditionally, production processes with P. pastoris describe fed-batch processes based on feed forward regimes with a constant specific growth rate. However, this strategy does not consider physiological changes of the organism, bearing the risk of overfeeding and thus harming the cells. Recently, we introduced the specific substrate uptake rate as a novel physiological parameter to design fed-batch strategies for P. pastoris. We showed that by doing dynamic batch experiments strain specific parameters, which are needed to set up respective feeding profiles, can be easily determined. Furthermore we proved that dynamics during feeding directly affects productivity and product purity.

By means of numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis we determine the phase diagram in the plane that is spanned by the gap costs and the temperature. We use the most frequently used parameter set for protein alignment. The critical exponents that describe the parameter driven transition are found to be explicitly temperature dependent. Furthermore, we study the shape of the (free-) energy distribution close to the transition by rare-event simulations down to probabilities of the order $10^{-64}$. It is well known that, in the logarithmic region, the optimal score distribution (T=0) is described by a modified Gumbel distribution.

Analysis of curriculum documents from 28 OECD countries, including China and South Africa, reveals that although there is a prevalence of astronomy related content in most grades, incorporating Robotic Telescopes and Student Research into the regular science curriculum is limited by two interdependent factors. Firstly, the majority of curricula introduce astronomy-related concepts through a descriptive lens, with a focus on the “what?”, rather than the “how?” or “why?”. Secondly, astronomy in comparison to other topics gets very little time allocation. Robotic Telescopes provide teachers with enormous potential to teach students not only topics related to science, but also to afford students the opportunity to engage in “authentic science”.

This study investigated the molecular mechanisms by which BBR suppresses the growth of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. The results show that BBR induces G1-phase cell cycle arrest by interfering with the expression of cyclins D1 and E and that it induces cellular apoptosis through the induction of a mitochondria/caspase pathway. The data also indicate that BBR inhibits cellular growth and promotes apoptosis by down-regulating the HER2/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

First, the osteogenic potential of rabbit OMCS was evaluated. Then, the OMCS were transplanted into the interface between the grafted tendon and the bone tunnel created at the tibia. Histological assessments and biomechanical tensile testing were performed after 3 weeks. The rabbit OMCS showed high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, positive staining of ALP, and osteogenic potential when transplanted subcutaneously with beta tricalcium phosphate disks. Newly formed bony walls and positive collagen type I staining were seen around the grafted tendon with OMCS transplantation, whereas such bony walls were thinner or less frequent without OMCS transplantation. Micro-computed tomography images showed significantly higher bone volume in the OMCS transplantation group. The pullout strength was significantly higher with OMCS (0.74 ± 0.23 N/mm(2)) than without OMCS (0.58 ± 0.15 N/mm(2)). These results show that OMCS enhance early tendon to bone tunnel healing.

The Regulation introduced, in addition to the Community registered design right (""CRDR""), a Community unregistered design right (""CUDR"") which is very similar to the CRDR. The CUDR came into force on 6 March 2002. It is in part based on the British invention of the unregistered design right or design right (""UDR""). Before the introduction of the CUDR, this type of right did not exist anywhere else in Europe. While the registered design right (""RDR"") existed in Great Britain since the 18th century, the British legislature only introduced UDR in 1988 while reforming the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (""CDPA""); the UDR entered into force on 1 August 1989.

The Boyarins’ diasporic thinking can be applied to diverse contemporary Jewish comedic texts like Roth’s “The Conversion of the Jews,” Englander’s “What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank,” and Auslander’s Hope, A Tragedy. Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, and Larry David also reject traditional forms of Jewish comedy (the need for group identity and solidarity in the face of suffering, persecution, genocide, powerlessness) in favor of an emancipated diaspora that maintains identity while it is outer directed and engages the Other. Although Jewish “diaspora” humor is traditionally associated with disenfranchisement, vulnerability and persecution, Daniel and Jonathan Boyarin view it as an opportunity for an increasingly powerful Jewish identity that benefits from what was once a liability: diaspora or geographical dis persion. By separating communal identity from land acquisition, Jews are able to maintain a sense of group particularity without the domination of the Other, thereby substituting cultural collaboration for confrontation. This version of diasporic thinking complements American egalitarianism at the same time that it expands the scope and affect of traditional Jewish humor. Although, in 1951, Irving Howe could not imagine how the traditional Jewish humor of the embattled European diaspora would translate into an enfranchised, empowered American idiom, I argue that in the hands of Philip Roth, Nathan Englander, and Shalom Auslander as well as popular artists like Jerry Seinfeld, Woody Allen, Larry David, and others, a new form of Jewish diasporic humor is not only thriving in America but",0,train,341

Evidence is first presented that the null of unit root with drift (constant, linear, or nonlinear) can be rejected in favor of nonlinear trend stationarity for the variables. Then, Bierens' (2000) nonlinear co-trending test finds two common nonlinear trends among the variables. The trends are consistent with a standard money demand relationship. All unit root and co-trending test conclusions are based on size and power results from Monte Carlo simulations as well as on asymptotic critical values. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the observed nonlinear trending and co-trending might arise in a theoretical model, and with implications for further empirical tests.",1,train,147
3773415,"In imaging studies of neonates, particularly in the clinical setting, diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography is typically unreliable due to the use of fast acquisition protocols that yield low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These image acquisition protocols are implemented with the aim of reducing motion artifacts that may be produced by the movement of the neonate's head during the scanning session. Furthermore, axons are not yet fully myelinated in these subjects. As a result, the water molecules' movements are not as constrained as in older brains, making it even harder to define structure using diffusion profiles. Here, we introduce a post-processing method that overcomes the difficulties described above, allowing the determination of reliable tracts in newborns. We tested our method using neonatal data and successfully extracted some of the limbic, association and commissural fibers, all of which are typically difficult to obtain by direct tractography. Geometrical and diffusion based features of the tracts are then utilized to compare premature babies to term babies. Our results quantify the maturation of white matter fiber tracts in neonates.",1,train,175

The most comprehensive framework for the Extended Synthesis is the Major Transitions in Evolution. The Extended Synthesis rests comfortably within a philosophical perspective in which biology does not need to be connected with other areas of science in order to justify itself. I am attracted to an older concept in which biology needs a covering law to connect it with the rest of the natural sciences. Darwin implicated a “higher law,” but did not specify it.

53030383,"OMI/HTRA2 (high-temperature requirement serine protease A2) is a mitochondrial serine protease involved in several cellular processes, including autophagy, chaperone activity, and apoptosis. Few studies on the role of OMI/HTRA2 in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are available, but none on its relationship with the cholinergic system and neurotrophic factors as well as other AD-related proteins. In this study, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that AD patients had a higher cytosolic distribution of OMI/HTRA2 protein compared to controls. Quantitative analyses on brain extracts indicated a significant increase in the active form of OMI/HTRA2 in the AD brain. Activated OMI/HTRA2 protein positively correlated with stress-associated read-through acetylcholinesterase activity. In addition, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene expression, a receptor also known to be localized on the outer membrane of mitochondria, showed a strong correlation with OMI/HTRA2 gene expression in three different brain regions. Interestingly, the activated OMI/HTRA2 levels also correlated with the activity of the acetylcholine-biosynthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT); with levels of the neurotrophic factors, NGF and BDNF; with levels of the soluble fragments of amyloid precursor protein (APP); and with gene expression of the microtubule-associated protein tau in the examined brain regions. Overall, the results demonstrate increased levels of the mitochondrial serine protease OMI/HTRA2, and a coherent pattern of association between the activated form of OMI/HTRA2 and several key proteins involved in AD pathology. In this paper, we propose a new hypothetical model to highlight the importance and needs of further investigation on the role of OMI/HTRA2 in the mitochondrial function and AD.",1,train,248

The lessons were deployed in regular mathematics classrooms, one lesson per day over a week, with 138 boys and girls in the 9th grade in the United States. After taking the weeklong agent-based lessons, students decreased in their mathematics anxiety (p = .042) and increased in mathematics learning (p = .001), regardless of the presence or absence of the agents’ anxiety messages. The presence of the agents’ messages only seemed to make a difference for high-anxiety students.

Several technologies have been mobilised in a large scale that had not been predicted to play any significant role. However, many observers continue to criticize the CDM Executive Board's handling of the project cycle and the lack of development benefits of CDM projects. Therefore, calls for CDM reform have gained strength. An analysis of the CDM project portfolio shows that Least Developed Countries and Africa have so far been sidelined. However, more small-scale projects have been submitted than expected from theoretical analyses of project cycle transaction cost, maybe due to high CER price expectations and a high share of unilateral projects. While developing country companies have been able to capture almost half of the CDM consultancy market, they have not made an inroad into validation and verification. The concentration of host countries has increased. Development benefits of CDM projects are often limited, especially of the large projects destroying industrial gases.

As part of this community, maintaining a connection with program alumni is vital for assessing the achievement of the program educational objectives. Even with a small engineering program such as our Mechanical Engineering program, establishing an engineering community can be complicated due to factors such as the very diverse student population, and the lack of an alumni association in the school. Many of the students in our program work full time, and most are part time students. The students go through the program as non-cohort groups, making information dissemination more difficult.

This study analyzes the 2006 Latino National Survey with geographic identifiers to explore how the political context of a county influences Latino partisan self-identification. There are a variety of reasons why the political environment might influence Latinos’ partisan choice. First, a substantial proportion of the adult Latino population in the United States is foreign-born, potentially lessening the influence of parental partisan socialization. Second, increased migration to areas outside the Southwest has exposed Latinos to new and different social, political, and economic environments. Using subgroup analysis, interactive logit models, and regression discontinuity, we find that the local political context influences the party attachment of Latino immigrants in predictable ways. However, for Latinos born in the United States, our analysis does not provide evidence of a causal connection between partisan environment and an individual's partisan identification.",0,train,161

The demographic evolution is expected to have considerable impact upon various, major aspects of the economic and social life in all European countries. The healthcare system plays an important role especially in the context of ageing societies, such as Germany. This paper focuses on the evolution of the prevention or rehabilitation service sector during the last years in Germany, analyzes the specific characteristics of the elderly patients being cared for in these facilities and underlines important aspects at the interface between (acute) hospital and geriatric rehabilitative care. Networking, integrated care services and models will be of even greater importance in the future demographic setting generating (most probably) increasing numbers and percentages of elderly, multimorbid hospitalized patients. More than this, the cooperation at regional level between acute geriatric hospital departments and geriatric rehabilitation facilities has become a mandatory quality criterion in the Free State of Bavaria. This paper presents and analyzes issues referring to a precise cooperation model (between acute and rehabilitative care) recommended for implementation even by the Free State of Bavaria while emphasizing several examples of good practice that have guaranteed the success of this cooperation model. The analysis of the main causes leading to longer length of stay (and thus ""delayed discharges"") for the elderly patients transferred to geriatric rehabilitation facilities within the reference model for acute-rehabilitative care provides important information and points at the existing potential for optimization in the acute hospital setting. Vicinity, tight communication and cooperation, early screening, implementation of standard procedures and case management are some of the activities that have contributed considerably to the improvement of the hospital length of stay and transfer management for elderly patients benefiting from (follow-up) inpatient geriatric rehabilitation services.

8824642,"The anaerobic digestion process comprises a whole network of sequential and parallel reactions, of both biochemical and physicochemical nature. Mathematical models, aiming at understanding and optimization of the anaerobic digestion process, describe these reactions in a structured way, the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) being the most well established example. While these models distinguish between different microorganisms involved in different reactions, to our knowledge they all neglect species diversity between organisms with the same function, i.e. performing the same reaction. Nevertheless, available experimental evidence suggests that the structure and properties of a microbial community may be influenced by process operation and on their turn also determine the reactor functioning. In order to adequately describe these phenomena, mathematical models need to consider the underlying microbial diversity. This is demonstrated in this contribution by extending the ADM1 to describe microbial diversity between organisms of the same functional group. The resulting model has been compared with the traditional ADM1 in describing experimental data of a pilot-scale hybrid Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Filter Bed (UASFB) reactor, as well as in a more detailed simulation study. The presented model is further shown useful in assessing the relationship between reactor performance and microbial community structure in mesophilic CSTRs seeded with slaughterhouse wastewater when facing increasing levels of ammonia.",1,train,213
141749399,"Rapid changes in educational settings place pressure on teachers to update their professional knowledge and skills, which can be accomplished by their participation in continuous professional development (CPD) programmes. The notion that teachers are true lifelong learners implies that they should hold positive attitudes and values needed to excel in learning. However, information on how teachers value their learning is sparse. This paper examines the dimensions of value placed on learning by teachers who undertook further learning as part of their CPD. As professionals, teachers are workers; therefore, their learning context is inevitably career-oriented. Thus, a Learning Value Scale questionnaire was developed by adapting Super’s Work Values Inventory proposed by Super and Neville (1986). The respondents were 599 teachers categorised into four groups—three groups engaged in different types of learning programmes (Undergraduate (UG), Postgraduate (PG), and Generic), and the control group did not participate in any learning activities. The responses were subjected to Principal Component Analysis. Results show that teachers see learning in four dimensions which are conceptually meaningful for, or associate with, the values of Achievement, Humanitarian Concern, Status, and Career Security. Examination of individual item responses across groups reveals that items for economic and job promotion show a distinct difference between the UG and Generic groups. In light of these findings, the study discusses the systemic cultural factors that conditioned the teachers’ concept of the value of learning. This baseline data can help teacher educators to understand teachers’ identity as learners. The findings also suggest that policy makers should review their learning policy initiative, and teachers as implementers of education should reflect on their own practice of learning.

During the Cold War, U.S. concerns focused on the global contest between democracy and communism. In this competition Pakistan was seen as an important ally. However, Pakistan viewed India as it primary threat and considered global ideological concerns as secondary in importance. At times, each country benefited from the other, but neither ever fully met the other's most important needs. The United States did not support Pakistan in its wars with India and Pakistan did not confront communism except to help oust Afghani governments non-compliant with Pakistan's interests. Pakistan's military held power for more than half of Pakistan's existence and became the U.S. key ally in South Asia. Pakistan's pursuit of nuclear weapons distanced U.S. relations in the post-Cold War environment. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 catapulted Pakistan's importance as an ally but at the cost of supporting a military regime and the erosion of a democratic government in Pakistan.

This study discusses the male dominance phenomenon through domestic violence in patriarchal society. It positions woman as a secondary level to man. The implications of woman as the “other” and the secondary level are discussed using feminism theory by Simone de Beauvoir and using the Sexual Politics by Kate Millet as the supporting theory. The methodology that is used is qualitative textual analysis in order to analyze the narrative and non-narrative aspects as data of analysis to carry out the ideological meaning within the film. The aim of the analysis is to portray the domestic violence in the forms of physical violence, psychological or emotional abuse, sexual violence, and threat of physical or sexual violence perpetrated by Chuck Traynor that show the male dominance by patriarchal society. It also aims to show the existing portrayal of the sex industry and depict Linda’s struggle in dealing with domestic violence and the enslavement of the sex industry. However, the male dominance can happen because of traditional gender stereotypes and the term second sex victimizes the woman as sexual exploitation of man and tends to make woman struggles. By focusing on male dominance that occurred could highlight the issue of domestic violence experienced by woman in the film with its effects toward woman in order to reduce the number of domestic violence and gender discrimination in every field.

Despite major advantages, including shorter duration of operation, minimal blood loss and decreased postoperative pain, many surgeons still prefer laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy. It is likely that the unfamiliar anatomical environment, smaller working space and long learning curve impede implementation. The present study assessed the number of procedures required to fulfil the surgical learning curve for posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The first consecutive posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomies performed by four surgical teams from university centres in three different countries were analysed. The primary outcome measure was duration of operation. Secondary outcomes were conversion to an open or laparoscopic transperitoneal approach, complications and recovery time. The learning curve cumulative sum (LC-CUSUM) was used to assess the learning curves for each surgical team. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: A total of 181 surgical procedures performed by four surgical teams were analysed. The median age of the patients was 57 (range 15-84) years and 61·3 per cent were female. Median tumour size was 25 (range 4-85) mm.

This will result in a new understanding of human biology as well as in the design of new molecular structures as potential novel diagnostic or drug discovery targets. The assessment of gene function may be performed using the tools of the genome program. These tools represent high-throughput methods used to evaluate changes in the expression of many or all genes of an organism at the same time in order to investigate genetic pathways for normal development and disease. This will lead to a shift in the scientific paradigm: In the pre-proteomics era, functional assignments were derived from hypothesis-driven experiments designed to understand specific cellular processes. The new tools describe proteins on a proteome-wide scale, thereby creating a new way of doing cell research which results in the determination of three-dimensional protein structures and the description of protein networks. These descriptions may then be used for the design of new hypotheses and experiments in the traditional physiological, biochemical and pharmacological sense. The evaluation of genetically manipulated animals or newly designed biomolecules will require a thorough understanding of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology and the experimental approaches will involve many new technologies, including in vivo imaging with single-photon emission tomography and positron emission tomography. Nuclear medicine procedures may be applied for the determination of gene function and regulation using established and new tracers or using in vivo reporter genes such as enzymes, receptors, antigens or transporters. Pharmacogenomics will identify new surrogate markers for therapy monitoring which may represent potential new tracers for imaging. Also, drug distribution studies for new therapeutic biomolecules are needed, at least during preclinical stages of drug development. Finally, new biomolecules will be developed by bioengineering methods which may be used for isotope-based diagnosis and treatment of disease.",0,train,314
157040758,"While supply chain scholars have made considerable progress in theory building and testing, there has been a relative dearth of middle range theory. Middle-range theory (MRT) is context-specific conceptualization providing theoretically grounded insights readily applicable to an empirical context. It promotes rigorous and relevant research, bridges practice and theory, and conveys deeper understanding of how and why phenomena occur. The lack of significant MRT is surprising given the considerable efforts supply chain scholars exert to stay grounded in industry practices. As a result, the authors put forth a broad call for more middle-range theorizing and provide guidance on how supply chain scholars may meet this call. Specifically, they describe a MRT lever—theoretical contextualization—that strikes a balance between theory and industry and then present two overarching strategies (bottom-up and top-down) for MRT development. The authors discuss these strategies in the supply chain domain and identify how middle-range theorizing may be undertaken in four emerging, yet important, topics.",0,train,156

Following such changes it can be difficult for carers to know whether or not to apply advance directives: should the person’s apparent current choices be respected or should they be overridden by choices that were made before the dementia developed? This question raises further questions about the nature of autonomy and identity and how these are affected by the various kinds of functional damage caused by dementia. Ronald Dworkin answered this question by arguing that identity is based around what he terms “critical interests” and that these interests are formed prior to the onset of dementia, which means that prior decisions should be applied. Agnieszka Jaworska has criticized this view and argued that people with dementia retain the capacity to form new critical interests because they retain the capacity to value.

This study was performed to evaluate the association between early discharge and long-term outcomes of patients with traumatic ICH. Methods: In this prospective cohort, patients with traumatic ICH referring to the emergency departments (EDs) of two teaching hospitals were investigated. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded in the checklists and then a radiologic assessment was done. According to the time of discharge, the patients were divided into two groups: early discharge (≤ 24 hours) and late discharge (> 24 hours). The collected data were analyzed using SPSS-24. Results: A total of 28 patients (84.8%) in the early discharge group and 36 patients (81.8%) in the late discharge group completed the study. The age distribution was similar in the two groups. The most common clinical symptoms after discharge were a headache in the first group and a headache plus vertigo in the second group (n = 7, 25.0% vs. n = 4, 11.1%; P = 0.020).

In response, many institutions have turned to corporate principles to run their operation and to recruit their ‘customers’ (that is, the students themselves). This exploratory study serves to ascertain whether using a relationship marketing approach is conducive to the task of identifying, selecting and recruiting highly desirable students. In this respect, particular emphasis is placed on whether these individuals are actually interested in establishing a pre-application relationship with a selected number of institutions, as well as the benefits they hope to accrue from such relationships. A hypothesized framework is thereafter appended as a guide for initiating and developing relationships with prospective students. Key variables influencing the decision process were probed. The reputation of the institution was found to be the most important factor in a scholar’s decision of a place of further study, followed by geographic location and thereafter campus safety. However, these differed between ethnic groups. Scholars’ receptiveness to the prospect of entering into a pre-application relationship with a tertiary education institution was found to be favourable. A mere eight percent of respondents claimed that they didn’t wish to have a relationship with an institution prior to the applications period. The remainder wished to be associated with one or more institutions. It was concluded that on average, the more serious scholar is interested in relationships with two institutions. In this regard, the factors attracting scholars to such relationships were identified. The availability of financial aid was found to be the most prominent factor, followed by curriculum advice and reduced application fees. It was therefore concluded that scholars seek real value and are less concerned with social benefits.",1,train,304

[1] Child abuse and neglect are serious global issues and can be physical, sexual or psychological. Many research studies have shown that children under the age group of 5-12 are at a higher risk of suffering from child abuse and neglect. The statistical analysis says that 40 million children become victims of child abuse all over the globe and 1,850 die due to extensive abuse and lack of affection and attention. An attempt has been made to differentiate the types of abuses and neglect, the signs and symptoms, the impact of the trauma on the well-being of the child.

The study conducted by the Government of India in 2015 estimates the burden of sexual abuse which revealed shocking results and showed that every second child in the country was abused; among them, 52.94 per cent were boys and 47.06 per cent were girls. Highest sexual abuse was reported in Assam (52.27%) followed by Delhi (41%), Andhra Pradesh (33.87%) and Bihar (33.27%).

Nonverbal children can learn to sign spontaneously to express their desires, to initiate social interaction, and to describe aspects of their world; they also sign egocentrically to guide their own behavior. This spontaneous signing, it is argued here, develops as an adaptation and extension of the behavior of goal-directed grasping to the tasks of social communication.

The language of brave space conveys a tone for engagement while also proposing a manner of engagement (Cook-Sather, 2016). The transformative experience of engaging in student-faculty partnership in and of itself constitutes a brave space where learners transition from dependence on authority to self-authorship (Baxter-Magolda, 2009, 2014). Within this paper we share Nicole’s lived experience engaging in authentic learning within the brave space created through pedagogical partnership. Nicole’s expression of her teaching philosophy privileges the importance of the shared accountability that students and educators have for teaching and learning and represents how she embraced the notion of self-authorship to create an understanding of how her teaching philosophy informs her growing practice as a registered nurse.",0,train,153
18144711,"Transcription by RNA polymerase I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a series of transcription factors that have been genetically and biochemically identified. In particular, the core factor (CF) and the upstream activation factor (UAF) have been shown in vitro to bind the core element and the upstream promoter element, respectively. We have analyzed in vivo the DNAse I footprinting of the 35S promoter in wild-type and mutant strains lacking one specific transcription factor at the time. In this way we were able to unambiguously attribute the protections by the CF and the UAF to their respective putative binding sites. In addition, we have found that in vivo a binding hierarchy exists, the UAF being necessary for CF binding. Because the CF footprinting is lost in mutants lacking a functional RNA polymerase I, we also conclude that the final step of preinitiation-complex assembly affects binding of the CF, stabilizing its contact with DNA. Thus, in vivo, the CF is recruited to the core element by the UAF and stabilized on DNA by the presence of a functional RNA polymerase I.",1,train,178

Design: The paper has the character of a cross-sectional validation study. Methods: The study was conducted between November 2015 and January 2016. The convenience sample consisted of 207 registered nurses working in internal care units at a specific faculty hospital in the Czech Republic. Analysis of the psychometric properties of the HSOPS was conducted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reliability testing. Results: Acceptable psychometric properties of the HSOPS were verified in our study. We confirmed 12 components of the HSOPS, the same number stated in the original version from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The reliability of the instrument was evaluated using the Cronbach alpha coefficient, and is considered acceptable. Conclusion: These findings can help healthcare institutions to raise awareness of patient safety culture and to gain a comprehensive overview of the individual dimensions of patient safety culture. In the future, the instrument could help to compare the components of patient safety culture, not only at a national but also at an international level. ::: Keywords: factor analysis, Hospital survey on patient safety culture, internal care units, instrument, nurse, patient safety culture, reliability",1,train,215
49484140,"Introduction Resident financial health has been linked to wellness and resiliency, yet financial literacy among residents is highly variable. While some medical school curricula include budgeting and student loan education, content on managing finances as a resident is usually lacking. We sought to quantitatively assess residents' financial circumstances, needs, and interests to inform the design of a resident personal finance curriculum. Methods Surveys were sent to residents in eight specialties at an academic medical center. Likert-type responses allowed respondents to rate their level of comfort (1 = Very Uncomfortable, 7 = Very Comfortable) and interest (1 = Very Uninterested, 7 = Very Interested) in various personal finance topics including budgeting, loan repayment, disability insurance, life insurance, home buying, and retirement planning. Details regarding financial circumstances, including assets, liabilities, and insurance, were also collected. Results of questions that utilized a Likert-type scale are reported as median (interquartile range). Results Of 346 residents surveyed, 144 (41.6%) responded. Residents were from Internal Medicine (56, 38.9%), Pediatrics (34, 23.6%), Emergency Medicine (18, 12.5%), and other specialties (36, 25.0%). Ninety-one (63.2%) reported educational loans, with an average balance of $191,730. Credit card balances exceeding $3,000 were reported by 11 (7.6%) respondents. One-hundred-two (70.1%) reported emergency savings, but only 65 (45.1%) reported having a retirement account (average balance $27,608). Respondents rated highest comfort levels with budgeting (5[4-6]), and lowest level of comfort with disability insurance (2[2-4]) and home buying (2[2-5]). Interest in learning each topic was high (6[5-7]), with retirement planning (6[5-7]), investing (6[5-7]), and home buying (6[5-7]) the topics of highest interest. Conclusion These results highlight the deficits in personal finance literacy among residents.

143778226,"Historic novel, besides its achievements, problems and the many debates on its typological assesment, represents the most studied type by critics worldwide. Along with European novel, the Historic Albanian novel is written on novel awereness, but the later, due to political causes, conserved this romantic spirit longer. Therefore it’s present nowadays not just for political issues, but because of existential ones. Besides other characteristics this type of novel reveals, it’s on our interest to bring to evidence the features it gained by some writers of the second half of the 20th century like: SabriGodo, Jusuf Buxhovi, Bilal Xhaferri, Ismail Kadare, Dhimiter Shuteriqi, Skender Drini, Mira Meksi, Ben Blushi etc. It’s obvious that in the modern hist.novel of the second half of the 20th century, critical awereness towards history is seen as realistic one. In the Balkans today’s novel represents the strengthening of the national conscience , whilst the European one represents the national crisis, the resistance to cosmopolitan issues as well as the concern on various types of ideology. The hist. Alb. novel of the beginning of the 21st century changes from being narrative to authentic fiction; therefore it enriches the Albanian novel through direct reference on historic truth. Kadare’s novel, which develops a new attitude towards history ; its parody on historical function as an opposition to censorship, makes out the most innovative example in this context. The typological mixture is a presentation of the inner development of our literature indicating structural changes due to actual social and cultural Albanian structure after the 90’s.

10985994,"Certain postoperative wounds are recognised to be associated with more complications than others and may be termed high-risk. Wound healing can be particularly challenging following high-energy trauma where wound necrosis and infection rates are high. Surgical incision for joint arthrodesis can also be considered high-risk as it requires extensive and invasive surgery and postoperative distal limb swelling and wound dehiscence are common. Recent human literature has investigated the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) over high-risk closed surgical incisions and beneficial effects have been noted including decreased drainage, decreased dehiscence and decreased infection rates. In a randomised, controlled study twenty cases undergoing distal limb high-energy fracture stabilisation or arthrodesis were randomised to NPWT or control groups. All cases had a modified Robert-Jones dressing applied for 72 h postoperatively and NPWT was applied for 24 h in the NPWT group. Morphometric assessment of limb circumference was performed at six sites preoperatively, 24 and 72 h postoperatively. Wound discharge was assessed at 24 and 72 h. Postoperative analgesia protocol was standardised and a Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Score (GCPS) carried out at 24, 48 and 72 h. Complications were noted and differences between groups were assessed. Percentage change in limb circumference between preoperative and 24 and 72 h postoperative measurements was significantly less at all sites for the NPWT group with exception of the joint proximal to the surgical site and the centre of the operated bone at 72 h. Median discharge score was lower in the NPWT group than the control group at 24 h. No significant differences in GCPS or complication rates were noted.

Selected self- reported HBCs in the past 12 months by BMI category were examined in this secondary analysis of the Canadian Community Health Survey 4.1. These HBCs included increased sports/exercise, weight loss and improved eating habits. Barriers to HBC were also examined. Results: Our final sample was n = 111 449. Overall, 58% of respondents had made an HBC, with increased sports/exercise as the most important HBC in 29% of the sample, followed by improved eating habits (10%) and weight loss (7%). Half (51%) experienced barriers to HBC; lack of will power was most commonly cited, followed by work and family responsibilities. Obese respondents reported HBC more frequently than normal-weight respondents (60% vs. 55%), but the prevalence of increased sports/ exercise and improved eating habits was similar across BMI categories. Regression models accounted for only 6%-10% of the total variance. Conclusion: That a majority of respondents had made at least one HBC bodes well for positively shifting population health. Additional work to further characterize the population, and to improve on population indicators, is needed to assess the impact of health promotion/disease prevention efforts.

It is emphasized that liability has an advantage over taxation: inefficiency of incentives arises under taxation when, as would be typical, it would be impractical for a tax to reflect all variables that significantly affect expected harm, whereas efficiency of incentives under liability does not require the state to determine expected harm - it requires only that injurers pay for harm that occurs. However, taxation enjoys an advantage over liability: incentives under liability are diluted to the degree that injurers might escape suit. The optimal joint use of taxation and liability is also examined, and it is shown in the model that is analyzed that liability should be employed fully because liability creates more efficient incentives than taxation; a tax should be used only to take up the slack due to the possibility that suit for harm would not be brought.",1,train,153

153464347,"During the past years, rare diseases have been one of the main themes on the European Union’s agenda. The reason for this theme being highlighted is the excellent exchange of knowledge between EU policy makers and the relevant patient communities. The former negligence has been caused by the apparent low patient numbers. The definition of a rare disease in Europe contains, that there are less than five patients out of a total population of 10000 persons suffering from this disease. Taking the total of all patients, suffering from rare diseases, it becomes a different number. An estimated 30 million EU citizens are suffering from a rare disease. This tells us that rare diseases are actually not exactly rare. Due to the great part of the population,which is affected, we have a social obligation to prioritise on this matter. Furthermore, the type of health conditions deserves a strong focus. The European Union, and notably the European Parliament, has made significant progress towards the provision of a political framework, which would define rare diseases and provide incentives for the research and development of medicines. The EU Orphan Medicines Regulation, adopted in 1999, was a political milestone in the prioritisation of rare diseases. It has provided the European Union with a clear competence in refining this topic. It was this legislation, which created incentives for medical manufacturers to develop products, furthermore, they generated a market exclusivity going beyond patent protection and a fee waiver for the evaluation and registration process of specialized products. The establishment of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) in 1995, meant the foundation of a centralised body, which can appropriately deal with the necessary central registration of available and registered medicines. This has been a great success story. Since then, 639 products have been registered with the European Medicines Agency.

8974241,"Fisheries are subject to a deep-rooted problem of economic inefficiency, often referred to as the fisheries problem. The fisheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones. Which institutions are most appropriate depends on the social objectives of the fisheries. There are strong economic arguments for the view that there should be only a single objective, namely to maximize the present value of the flow of benefits from the fisheries. In reality, different interest groups often push for several, often conflicting, objectives. In that case a multi-objective programming approach may be appropriate. A set of institutions to manage fisheries is referred to as the fisheries management regime. The fisheries management regime consists of a (i) fisheries management system, (ii) fisheries enforcement system and (iii) fisheries judicial system. Each one of these has to be appropriately designed and implemented. The efficacy of the overall fisheries management regime cannot be greater than that of its weakest link. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to keep an eye on the cost of fisheries management. Global evidence suggests that the cost of fisheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. The problem, thus, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the fisheries management regime and its cost of design, implementation and operation. The problem of fisheries management is by its nature multidisciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, economics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring powerful modelling and calculation techniques. In many respects this is the kind of problem operations research techniques are designed to deal with.",1,train,301
56120572,"In investigating whether shared leadership can be tracked on a work-life level, this study aims to contribute knowledge about how common shared leadership is among managers in Sweden. A search was made for equal assumption of responsibilities and, specifically, for joint leadership, i.e. a formal mandate for decision-making affecting the full range of responsibilities attaching to the managerial post. The results show that shared leadership is tracked on a work-life level, and that the most far-reaching form joint leadership was found among 5 % of the managers. Thus, the phenomenon cannot be ignored as anecdotal. This adds relevance to influencing perceptions of leadership towards more pluralism, in which questions of leadership naturally incorporate more interactive variations than does the hitherto accepted theory of singular leadership.",0,train,125
18432173,"Abstract A reduced relative—main clause ambiguity occurs in sentences that begin with reduced relative clauses, as in The hangman executed by the government was convicted of treason . This ambiguity has often been the focus of research designed to investigate the processes by which syntactic structures are built during sentence comprehension. Reading time differences between more difficult and less difficult reduced relative sentences (e.g., The hangman executed by the government was convicted of treason vs. The martyr executed by the government was convicted of treason ) have been interpreted as reflecting syntactic disambiguation processes. In this article, we point out that there exists a possible alternative interpretation of the differences, namely, that reading times are longer for the more difficult sentences because the information in their relative clauses mismatches a reader’s general knowledge of how events typically occur in the world or how they are typically referenced in discourse. Under this interpretation, the differences in reading times do not have their bases in disambiguation processing.",0,train,165

A participatory democracy is not feasible without the equal inclusion of women’s voices under similar conditions to their male peers. In the past, various studies have shown that women in the media are either rendered invisible or described according to stereotyped characteristics, which results in their ‘symbolic annihilation’. Arguing that television remains an important mass medium in the delivery of news to the general public, a qualitative study was conducted which aimed at understanding how gender meanings in the evening news are negotiated by television viewers. Within this context, a series of focus group discussions was organized in order to examine several gender perceptions of the news which contribute to the development of a critical perspective on media structures and content.",0,train,138

The plasma concentration of verapamil was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and general peripheral vascular resistance (GPVR) were measured using integral rheography according to Tishchenko (Mingograf-410, Russia); blood pressure (BP) was measured by Korotkoff sounds. Analysis of verapamil pharmacokinetics in both experiments showed identity of the averaged curve profiles that did not differ significantly. The pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable. Based on hemodynamics analysis, HR elevation 1 h after verapamil administration was the most common reaction in both experiments; a short CO rise and GPVR decrease were observed in experiment 2 1 h after administration. These hemodynamic shifts were not pathologic and did not deviate from the physiological range in healthy people; changes in verapamil pharmacokinetics were also not detected. These findings provide the grounds to recommend verapamil for rational pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases that may develop in piloted space missions.",1,train,197
158555672,"Establishing an energy monitoring and management methodology is a quintessential milestone for informed energy savings decision making as well as for effectively reducing the cost and the environmental impact of shipping operations. In this study, a novel systematic methodology is proposed for the energy management of the ship propulsion engine, which is the largest ship energy producer. The methodology employs a combination of tools including statistical analysis, predicting the engine air flow via compressor modelling and energy and exergy analyses, whereas its output includes the engine operating profile, the most frequently occurring propeller curves and the engine most frequent operating points, the key performance indicators for quantitatively assessing the recorded parameters quality as well as the energy and exergy flows and exergy destruction of the engine components. The methodology is implemented for three case studies for a very large crude carrier, a container ship and a bulk carrier, for which recorded data were available by using different monitoring techniques from either noon reports of automatic data acquisition systems. The derived results provide the engine operating profile demonstrating that the investigated vessels were operating in slow steaming conditions with a lower engine efficiency associated with a greater exhaust gas wasted energy. The measured data analysis demonstrates the better quality of the data recorded by automated monitoring systems and pinpoint maintenance issues of the engine components. Lastly, the exergy analysis results demonstrate that the exhaust gas and jacket cooling water provide the greater exergy flows rendering them attractive for energy saving initiatives, whereas the engine block, compressor and turbine are the engine components with the greater exergy destruction, thus requiring closing monitoring for timely identifying mitigating measures.",0,train,275

The sample consisted of 200 college students (60.5% female, 39.5% male) who completed a revised version of the Conflict Tactics Scales and a self-labeling measure of sibling violence. Findings indicated that while the vast majority of the sample had experienced sibling violence, they utilized terminology in a manner that failed to recognize their experiences as a form of violence. When the data were classified according to gender and level of violence within the sibling relationship, quantitative analysis indicated a difference in terminology. In an attempt to interpret these results from the theoretical perspective of discourse as an aspect of social constructivism it was postulated that the study identified both a dominant discourse that renders physical violence among siblings invisible and several subordinate discourses by which individuals reflect their varying characteristics. It was suggested that future research utilize qualitative analysis to clarify and expand upon this interpretation.",0,train,163

The article evaluates recommendations of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples which refer to the notion of ‘advancement’ and prohibition of racial discrimination unless it is for the purpose of ‘overcoming disadvantage’. These issues are critically analysed in light of current law and policy intended to be beneficial for Australia’s First Peoples: the new Indigenous Advancement Strategy announced in the 2014-15 Federal Budget; and the Improving School Enrollment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure (‘SEAM’).

The study contributes to the literature on persistence in productivity along four main lines. First, it develops a conceptual framework that links the persistence in productivity performance to persistence at the firm level in innovative activities, which include the adoption and imitation of innovations introduced by third parties. Second, it shows how the internal characteristics of companies, including the propensity of managers to leverage dynamic capabilities, can shape the dynamics of the process. Third, it confirms that external factors, such as the access to local pools of knowledge and the dynamics of economic activity, have relevant effects on persistence and shape its evolution along its path. Fourth, the use of Multiple Transition Probability Matrices (MTPMs) and the subsequent econometric analysis provides substantial evidence on the relevance of the crucial distinction, within non-ergodic dynamics, between past dependent processes, characterized by full hysteretic irrever sibility, and path dependent processes in which events that take place along the process may affect its direction and pace.",0,train,188

213618586,"Visual Art Education in Ghana and the world over has been structured to give a holistic training to the student with emphasis on hands on practical skills acquisition. It focuses on creativity and innovativeness towards the production of high quality artefacts to fulfill societal needs. It is line with this mandate that the Visual Art curriculum has been crafted to refine and train students in the various art disciplines such as Textiles, Sculpture, Ceramics, Leather Work, Jewellery, Basketry and Graphic Design, just to mention a few. However, certain developments in recent times militate against the realization of this mandate. The craze for Graphic Design at the expense of other art subjects has almost reached its peak. 8 out of every 10 Visual Art students in the Tertiary and Senior High Schools prefer to offer Graphic Design. This unfortunate development has left most of the other art related subjects with few students. In most of the Senior High Schools in Ghana, the other art subjects have been scrapped leaving Graphic Design, General Knowledge in Art and a 3 dimensional art subject as the (subject combination). As a result, most of the teachers who teach the other art related subjects have become redundant except a few who teach General Knowledge in Art. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the cause of the problem and to proffer solutions. The study adopted the Purposive Sampling Technique. The sample population was made up of two-hundred and ten (210) respondents. The main research tools employed to collect data for the study were questionnaire and interview.

However, when he is confronted with the skepticism of one of the officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport investigating the ship’s sinking, Pi provides an alternative version of his tale of survival, a version that replaces animals with people. Pi then puts a question to the investigators: “So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can’t prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?” When both officials choose the story with animals, Pi replies, “Thank you. And so it goes with God” (352). 3 Although reviewers of Life of Pi are, without exception, warm in their praise of Martel’s storytelling abilities, they have found his treatment of religion unpersuasive. As Peter Whittaker succinctly puts it: “This wonderful book did not make me believe in God but it did reinforce my faith in the considerable redemptive powers of fiction” (33).2 But this is precisely Martel’s point. He is not out to prove the existence of God, but rather to justify a belief in God’s existence. Martel’s position is a post-modernist one, from the perspective of which God’s existence has the same status in relation to truth and reality as Pi’s experience of shipwreck. Agnostics, Pi tells us, “lack imagination and miss the better story” (70). God’s existence, in other words, is a matter neither of fact nor of faith, but rather is a better story than the one told by those who doubt or deny God’s existence.",0,train,312

The aim of this study was to compare the academic performance on the historic arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard to the Grade Point Average (GPA) score attainment for pharmacy students examined between 2013 and 2017 at the University of Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 445 randomly selected final examination results for undergraduate pharmacy students examined between 2013 and 2017 at the University of Zambia. The data was analysed using Stata 13 and GraphPad Prism 5. For all the statistical tests conducted, normality of the data was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. There was statistically significant difference between the historic arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard and the course-specific examination composite score attainment in all the courses (P<0.0001). ::: Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference between the examinees’ GPA score attained and the acceptable GPA score of 3.0 (Median GPA 1.75; IQR: 0.75-2.25 and 1.67; IQR: 1.0-2.0) for the fourth and fifth-year examinees respectively). The comparison of the academic performance on the arbitrary 50% pass-fail standard and GPA score attainment for pharmacy students revealed that despite students demonstrating ability to attain high course-specific composite scores using the arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard, the attained median GPA score was statistically significantly less than the minimum acceptable GPA score of 3.0. While the 50% pass-fail standards’ precision to detect academic performance maybe questioned, the findings suggests that the incorporation of a credit point and GPA system for making assessment decisions to rate students, certification and graduation requirements in Health Professions Education may offer better precision and prediction to detect academic performance and competency attainment.",1,train,319

The paper unpacks what politicization is and how it might relate to democratic legitimacy. It then argues that problems surrounding representation – in particular the constructivist view of representation – complicates this relationship. Significantly the notion of mobilization generates suspicions of democratic representational legitimacy. In response, the paper details a framework for assessing the democratic legitimacy of representative claims under conditions of politicization that responds to the aforementioned concerns.

According to the empirical data obtained, after a twelve-year period (1995-2006) of inactivity in this area, the SCJN recently (2007-11) has begun to gradually take action. The change is evident in three aspects: a) the increased use and reinterpretation of its powers in Amparo proceedings; b) the increased use, interpretation and regulation of Powers of Investigation for serious violations of individual guarantees (abrogated in 2011), and; c) the inclusion of deliberative elements in preparing proceedings on grounds of unconstitutionality (Accion de Inconstitucionalidad). The change in the SCJN’s behavior towards human rights since 2007 is explained by the institutional independence it has gained in the fragmented political system in assuming the role of arbitrator in important conflicts between political actors. The SCJN has also developed strategies that legitimate its greater involvement in protecting human rights before the political system and society. In general, the political system under which the Court acts has not reacted to provoke a reversal of this tendency in favor of human rights.

55578592,"Recent decades have witnessed a remarkable rise in academic research and political discussion on borders and border regions. In broad terms, we can distinguish at least two major traditions which have developed more or less in parallel directions and in increasing interaction with one another. There is the older American tradition of “borderlands studies” that has gained new ground and forms today an established academic institution around the scholarly organization Association of Borderlands Studies (ABS) with its regular conferences and publications, most notably the Journal of Borderlands Studies (JBS). In this review I will concentrate on the more novel European based research tradition which has partly gained inspiration from the American scholarly discussion and partly opened new research directions, with certain influence on the broader international research community. This tradition is perhaps best known through the series of Border Regions in Transition (BRIT) conferences and the publications linked to them. Since the first gathering in Berlin in 1994, there have been ten BRIT conferences organized in Finland, the U.S., India, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Poland, Canada and Chile. Its activities have gathered together scholars from around the world, from Europe and the Americas as well as from Asian countries.

Given consistent parameter estimates from the selection equation obtained in the first stage, we estimate the semiparametric outcome equation using data for the observed individuals whose likelihood of being selected into the sample stays approximately the same over time. The selection bias term is then ""asymptotically"" removed from the equation along with fixed effects using kernel-based weights. The proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. We first investigate the finite sample properties of the estimator in a small Monte Carlo study and then apply it to study production technologies of U.S. retail credit unions from 2002 to 2006.",1,train,159

Results demonstrate that ARC treatment was associated with significant decreases in child symptoms and caregiver stress from pre- to post-treatment, which were maintained over a 12-month follow up period. Preliminary findings contribute to an emerging empirical basis for the ARC model and are supportive of its clinical utility as a practice with adopted children. Next steps include; a) expanding study findings by conducting controlled efficacy research, b) examining the transaction between child and caregiver factors as agents of change, and c) conducting longitudinal research of children and families receiving ARC to more deeply examine impact on resiliency.",1,train,122
154379635,"Security regulators and the business press have alleged that firms play an 'earnings-guidance game' where analysts make optimistic forecasts at the start of the year and then 'walk down' their estimates to a level the firm can beat by the end of the year. In a comprehensive sample of I/B/E/S individual analysts' forecasts of annual earnings from 1983-1998, we find strong support for the claim in the post-1992 period. We examine whether the 'walk down' to beatable targets is associated with managers' incentives to sell stock after earnings announcements on the firm's behalf (via new equity issuance) or from their personal accounts (insider trades). Consistent with these hypotheses, we find that the 'walk down' to beatable targets is most pronounced in firms that are either net issuers of equity or in firms where managers are net sellers of stock after an earnings announcement. These findings provide new insights on how capital market incentives affect communications between managers and analysts.",1,train,159

55829214,"Nowadays tourism economy is driven by information technology (IT) and telecommunications. All tourism oriented companies, such as tour operators, travel agencies, rental agencies, cruisers and hotels experience the growing impact of what is commonly known as information and communication technology (ICT). Tourism sector represents the information-intensive industry characterized by a significantly long value chain influenced, to a great extent, by information. Its creation, collection, storage, retrieval and transfer remain within the core activities of all tourism enterprises. Every single innovation in IT sector can potentially change the strategy followed by tourism companies in running a business. Such transformations are also imposed by tourists’ behaviors which keep altering under the influence of information technology. The process of tourist services purchase is based on information collected through many different channels, e.g. travel agencies, brochures, the word-of-mouth, or web sides offered by tourist service suppliers, which are currently gaining much importance. Consumer decision making process in tourism sector is transformed into an online one, since direct service booking has become possible. ::: Proper understanding of behaviors presented by those searching for travel information online, as well as using innovative information and communication technologies by tourists, remain essential for designing an effective ICT-based business model. Currently it seems to be the crucial challenge for the entire tourism sector. ICT is focused on designing the new scientific paradigm (by innovation, co-opetition, collaboration with customers) of tourism development based on modern e-technologies. ::: The paper discusses the level of information and communication technologies application in the tourism sector.

The research was based on Ghanaian folklore for children, which is popularly known as ‘By the Fireside Stories’, encapsulated traditionally as Anansesem or Spider stories among the Akan of Ghana. Data were collected through storytelling to a group of children and inviting them to recall their concurrent thinking during and after the storytelling. The children’s cognitive recall processes were stimulated by questions and story character dramatisation recorded on a digital video recorder and played back to the children. Findings showed major contributions to children’s learning and development related to imagination, concept formation and thinking, and beyond the self in social relationship. This paper draws attention to how traditional oral storytelling can be an important part of early childhood education to develop children’s reflective thinking about social life.",1,train,174

Sixty students majoring in Tourism were involved in the project. Discourse completion task (DCT) containing an invitation using three sociocultural aspects of low power (-P), low distance (-D), and low rank of imposition (-R) was used to elicit participants’ refusal strategies. Taxonomy of refusal proposed by Beebe, Takahashi, and Uliss-Weltz (1990) was applied to recognize refusal strategies used by participants. Result of the study revealed that there were three strategies of ‘direct, indirect, and adjunct to refusal’ used by participants in responding the invitation. However, two new sub-strategies found to enrich indirect strategies, they are ‘alternative (change subject)’ and ‘telling wish’.

Under this approach, if a state permits lawyers to review inadvertently disclosed privileged documents, the jurisdiction should also permit lawyers to review the metadata contained in electronic documents.

Results from 463 participants showed the majority (78%) reported studying in a group at least once per semester, with younger students engaging in more frequent group sessions.

The majority experienced higher motivation and learning from group study, but the majority also generally prefer individual over group study. Regarding self-regulated learning choices in a group setting, these did vary by discipline, but the most commonly used strategies overall were active, empirically supported ones such as practice problems, discussion, quizzing/testing, questioning, and making flashcards. In addition, several group study strategies were correlated with GPA, including making mnemonics, making flashcards, and distributed (spaced) study sessions. More advanced students tended to use discussion-based strategies during group study, and lower-level students were more likely to report content-driven strategies such as quizzing/testing and flashcards.

For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situa...",0,train,149

Pre-term children born low birth weight are at risk for behavioral and emotional difficulties, however, little is known about how these difficulties manifest and interact with biological risk and environmental factors. This study examined the extent to which children’s language and dyadic relationship factors facilitate affect regulation and behavior problems in low birth weight children (LBW). Sixty-eight preschool-age children and their mothers participated in the study. Children were administered an assessment of cognitive functioning in which verbal ability was examined, and engaged in a laboratory frustration task designed to elicit negative affect to assess emotion regulation. Results revealed correlations among verbal ability, behavior problems, behavioral synchrony, and emotion regulation. Group Differences were found in verbal ability and positive affect in which LBW children demonstrated lower verbal ability scores and less positive affect than full-term children. For the full sample, behavior synchrony moderated the relationship between verbal ability and negative emotion regulation. The results provide evidence of the importance of the functional role of language and dyadic relations in the development of affect regulation and behavior problems.

The experiment tests the effect of virtual currency endowments on player retention and virtual currency demand. An increase in endowments of a virtual currency should lower the demand for the currency in the short run. However, in the long run, we would expect money demand to rise in response to inflation in the virtual world. We test for this behavior in a virtual field experiment in the football management game Top11. 575,000 players were selected at random and allocated to different ""shards"" or versions of the world. The shards differed only in terms of the initial money endowment offered to new players. Money demand was observed for 28 days as players used real money to purchase additional virtual currency. The results indicate that player money purchases were significantly higher in the shards where higher endowments were given. This suggests that a positive change in the money supply in a virtual context leads to inflation and increased money demand, and does so much more quickly than in real-world economies.

154310792,"We run an experiment where 97 subjects could retrieve records of completed past auctions before placing their bids in current one-bid, two-bid, and auction-selection games. Each subject was asked to participate in 3 current auctions; but could retrieve up to 60 records of completed (past) auctions. The results reveal a positive relation between the payoffs earned by the subjects and their history-inspection effort. Subjects act as if responding to the average bidding-ratios of the winners in the samples that they have retrieved. They apply intuitive signal-dependent stopping rules like “sample until observing a winner-value close to my won” or “find a close winner-value and try one more history” when sampling the databases. History-inspection directs bidders with relatively high private-valuations to moderate bidding which increases their realized payoffs.

Main barriers were identified and differences between programs were analyzed. Associations between barriers and client background characteristics were investigated. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The most common barriers were failure to engage and disengagement from services, followed by substance abuse. Staff from the two employment programs reported similar barriers. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Engagement problems were the single most important barrier to employment across programs. Surprisingly, criminal history was rarely mentioned. This may be explained by barriers arising earlier in the process, before achieving employer contact. The results call for recognition and awareness of the importance of motivational issues as well as factors that may inhibit engagement in services, highlighting possible augmentations to evidence-based employment services that may be necessary in the rehabilitation of this patient group.",1,train,217
157111000,"In the last half decade, there has been a visible growth in the poultry industry of Bangladesh leading to an increase in the per capita availability and consumption of chicken meat and egg. Although this growth has resulted in the minimization of the gap of human protein requirement, but compared to other developing countries as well as developed countries, per capita meat consumption is still very much lower. So there is a vast opportunity to improve total poultry industry by setting proper strategy to manage challenges and using opportunities effectively as well as efficiently. As a result the prime objectives of researchers are to explore the challenges and opportunities of poultry hatcheries focusing on SME players. Primary data has been collected by in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with different tiers of poultry professionals. Major findings of the research are the knowledge gap in respect of competitive dynamics, strategic management, global linkage potentials and modern technologies as well as another prime constraint is funding and fund management in terms of accessibility, availability and affordability (3A).",1,train,175

Banking is an institutionally-intensive activity and the location decision of foreign banks provides a good test of how institutional differences are dealt with and how they may affect economic choices. Specifically, the authors examine whether banks seek out those markets where institutional familiarity provides them with a competitive advantage over other foreign competitor banks. Using bilateral data on banking sector foreign direct investment in all developing countries and controlling for other factors, they find that competitive advantage is an important factor in driving foreign banks'location decisions. The findings suggest that high institutional quality is not necessarily a prerequisite to attract foreign direct investment in banking and that there are specific benefits, as well as risks, to international financial integration between developing countries.",1,train,149

Methods : A retrospective study compared the data of surgical procedures, pathological features and prognosis of 61 cases of young females (≤ 40 years) and 507 cases of elderly females (> 40 years), treated in our department from August 2011 to July 2018. This data was analyzed using SPSS 23.0 program. Results : 10.74% of total cases, in this period of time, involve young females. In terms of surgical procedures, 24.59% of young patients underwent breast conserving surgery (8.48% elderly, respectively), and 13.11% underwent reconstruction surgery (1.18% elderly, respectively), with statistically significant differences existing between the two groups ( P < 0.05). Progesterone receptor (PR) expression in young women was significantly higher than in elderly females ( P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), expression of estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and Ki-67, but the lymphatic metastasis stage showed an increasing rate with younger age. No significant difference was found in 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Conclusion : The selection rate of breast conserving and reconstructive surgery in young women with breast cancer is significantly higher than that in elderly women.

The women job-seekers find jobs in banks more attractive and more suitable to their nature. Banks also were not only not averse to taking them but even welcomed their entry because women have certain innate traits which fit in with the job requirements. Thus the humongous increase in job opportunities in banks and the abundant availability of qualified women who get selected in job tests paved the way for the large number of women occupying positions in all cadres today in not only public sector and private sector banks but even in new generation banks.

19178965,"Background: Disasters affect close to 400 million people each year. Complex Emergencies (CE) are a category of disaster that affects nearly half of the 400 million and often last for several years. To support the people affected by CE, humanitarian assistance is provided with the aim of saving lives and alleviating suffering. It is widely agreed that funding for this assistance should be needs-based. However, to date, there is no model or set of indicators that quantify and compare needs from one CE to another. In an effort to support needs-based and transparent funding of humanitarian assistance, the aim of this study is to develop a model that distinguishes between levels of severity among countries affected by CE.Methods: In this study, severity serves as a predictor for level of need. The study focuses on two components of severity: vulnerability and exposure. In a literature and Internet search we identified indicators that characterize vulnerability and exposure to CE. Among the more than 100 indicators identified, a core set of six was selected in an expert ratings exercise. Selection was made based on indicator availability and their ability to characterize preexisting or underlying vulnerabilities (four indicators) or to quantify exposure to a CE (two indicators). CE from 50 countries were then scored using a 3-tiered score (Low-Moderate, High, Critical). Results: The developed model builds on the logic of the Utstein template. It scores severity based on the readily available value of four vulnerability and four exposure indicators. These are 1) GNI per capita, PPP, 2) Under-five mortality rate, per 1 000 live births, 3) Adult literacy rate, % of people ages 15 and above, 4) Underweight, % of population under 5 years, and 5) number of persons and proportion of population affected, and 6) number of uprooted persons and proportion of population uprooted.Conclusion: The model can be used to derive support for transparent, needs-based funding of humanitarian assistance. Further research is needed to determine its validity, the robustness of indicators and to what extent levels of scoring relate to CE outcome.",1,train,339

9294789,"Mental health policy-making in Ontario has a long history of frustrated attempts to move from a hospital and physician-based tradition to a coordinated system with greater emphasis on community-based mental health care. This study examines policy legacies associated with the introduction of psychiatric hospitals in the 1850s and the introduction of public health insurance (medicare) in the 1960s in Ontario; and their effect on subsequent mental health reform initiatives using a qualitative case study approach. Following Pierson (1993) we capture the resource/incentive and interpretive effects of prior policies on three groups of actors: government elites, interests and mass publics. Data is drawn from academic and policy literature, and key informant interviews. The findings suggest that psychiatric hospital policy resulted in important policy legacies which were reinforced by medicare. These legacies explain the traditional difficulty in achieving mental health reform, but are less helpful in explaining recent promising developments that support community-based care. Current reform of the Ontario health system features the introduction of regionalized service delivery and new models of interdisciplinary team-based primary care delivery and presents an opportunity to overcome several of these legacies.

1478836,"There is a long-standing controversy over the question of whether targeting social transfers towards the bottom part of the income distribution actually enhances or weakens their redistributive impact. Korpi and Palme have influentially claimed that ""the more we target benefits at the poor, the less likely we are to reduce poverty and inequality"". The basic empirical underpinning of this claim is a strong inverse relationship at the country level between social transfer targeting and redistributive impact. We show that this no longer holds as a robust empirical generalisation. The relationship between the extent of targeting and redistributive impact over a broad set of empirical specifications, country selections and data sources has in fact become a very weak one. For what it matters, targeting tends to be associated with higher levels of redistribution, especially when overall effort in terms of spending is high.

Consistent with our findings from previous work, party leaders appeared to construct more moderate and less divisive agendas in lame-duck sessions, which reflected leaders’ reduced ability to influence the behavior of departing members. The ability of party leaders to exert pressure in lame-duck sessions did not disappear, however, but rather took a different form: that of getting returning members to participate actively on roll-call votes.

32650545,"Abstract Radiocontrast administration remains the third leading cause of hospital-acquired acute renal failure. Clinically, radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RIN) is defined as a sudden decline in renal function after radiocontrast administration. Typically, the serum creatinine level begins to increase at 24 to 72 hours after the administration of contrast, peaks at 3 to 5 days, and requires another 3 to 5 days to return to baseline. RIN increases the incidence of life-threatening complications such as sepsis, bleeding, and respiratory failure and increases the cost of medical care by extending the hospital stay. The increased mortality associated with acute renal failure encountered in this scenario calls for a heightened awareness of the diagnosis and prevention of RIN. Whereas individuals with healthy renal function are not generally considered to be at particular risk for RIN, patients with preexisting renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus are much more likely to experience acute renal failure after contrast administration. In the past, a variety of therapeutic interventions have been used to prevent or attenuate RIN, including saline hydration, diuretics, mannitol, calcium channel antagonists, theophylline, endothelin receptor antagonists, hemodialysis, and dopamine. More recently, studies demonstrate a positive impact of fenoldopam (dopamine-1 receptor, dopamine-1 agonist) and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine in ameliorating RIN.

Resection of mesial structures of the temporal lobes, however, entails a significant risk of decreased memory function. Recent advances in the assessment of memory changes following temporal lobectomy surgery emphasize the complexity of subjective ratings of memory functioning in this population. Neuroimaging tools useful in the diagnostic evaluation of epilepsy surgical candidates have now been shown to be useful in predicting memory change in the post-surgical period. Functional magnetic resonance imaging appears to provide significant information regarding hemispheric representation of language in the temporal lobe epilepsy patient, and the use of this technique to predict memory status following surgery appears promising.

14440941,"MAIN CONCLUSION ::: Changes in root and leaf hydraulic properties and stimulation of transpiration rates that were initially triggered by defoliation were accompanied by corresponding changes in leaf and root aquaporin expression. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings were subjected to defoliation treatments by removing 50, 75 % or all of the leaves. Root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) was sharply reduced in plants defoliated for 1 day and 1 week. The decrease in L pr could not be prevented by stem girdling and it was accompanied in one-day-defoliated plants by a large decrease in the root expression of PIP1,2 aquaporin and an over twofold decrease in hydraulic conductivity of root cortical cells (L pc). Contrary to L pr and L pc, 50 and 75 % defoliation treatments profoundly increased leaf lamina conductance (K lam) after 1 day and this increase was similar in magnitude for both defoliation treatments. Transpiration rates (E) rapidly declined after the removal of 75 % of leaves. However, E increased by over twofold in defoliated plants after 1 day and the increases in E and K lam were accompanied by five- and tenfold increases in the leaf expression of PIP2;4 in 50 and 75 % defoliation treatments, respectively. Defoliation treatments also stimulated net photosynthesis after 1 day and 3 weeks, although the increase was not as high as E. Leaf water potentials remained relatively stable following defoliation with the exception of a small decrease 1 day after defoliation which suggests that root water transport did not initially keep pace with the increased transpirational water loss. The results demonstrate the importance of root and leaf hydraulic properties in plant responses to defoliation and point to the involvement of PIP aquaporins in the early events following the loss of leaves.",1,train,289

Factors related to workplace hypertension were assessed with multiple regression analysis. Workplace hypertension, defined as a BP no less than 140/90 mmHg, was observed in 23% of subjects (n=61). Compared with subjects without workplace hypertension (n=204), subjects with workplace hypertension were older (48.5+/-10.0 vs. 39.3+/-10.0 years), more likely to be men (69% vs. 46%), and had a higher body mass index (BMI) (23.4+/-2.7 vs. 21.6+/-3.2 kg/m(2)), higher cholesterol levels (214+/-33 vs. 194+/-36 mg/dl), and a higher Brinkman index (134+/-228 vs. 59+/-148).

151954792,"Abstract This paper discusses questions about sources of knowledge in Dutch police interviews with child witnesses. Police officers are instructed to ask these questions in order to allow participants in the criminal procedure to assess the reliability of the testimony. In everyday interaction, asking “how someone knows” implies that what was said earlier is not taken for granted. Therefore, questions about sources of knowledge in police interviews are potentially delicate. This paper aims to show that (a) questions about sources of knowledge are related to a specialized institutional inference system and (b) children sometimes treat those questions as causing a dilemma between the need to provide an answer and the unusual character of the question. Drawing on insights from conversation analysis, the analysis focuses on occasions when children present their answer about the source of their knowledge as self-evident. These responses suggest that the question is not genuine and legitimate. At the same time, children still try to provide a relevant answer. The self-evident answers thus deal with the explicit request for a source of knowledge and, from their perspective, the unnecessary character of the question. Police officers generally ignore the self-evident aspect of the answers in their uptakes. Yet, when they do orient to it, they justify their questions as genuine information seeking questions. Police officers thus treat sources of knowledge as something they did not know, whereas sources of knowledge often can be inferred in everyday language use. We suggest that taking this unknowing stance conveys to the child and to the tape that the police officers are not presuming specific sources of knowledge.",1,train,266

In order to stage a mega-event, tremendous infrastructure and construction are required with significant consumption of private and public resources. Multiple stakeholder groups are recognized as key entities responsible for an efficient trigger of a mega-event. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of Korean sport literature with regard to CSR practices (ES-linked) of different stakeholder groups and examine through a meta-analytic methodology their impact on the “images” of these groups. The CMA program was utilized as the main analysis tool to calculate the effect sizes from the selected empirical studies. The results indicated that CSR performance of governmental organizations had the highest effect size level on their own image (brand identity) as perceived by visitors and participants. Among the stakeholder groups, effect size levels of their CSR performances were followed by those of corporate sponsors and professional teams. It was found that stakeholder groups are pressured to maintain a balance between financial performance, consumer well-being, and brand identity to bring in external investment.",1,train,188

In particular, the difference among firms that used entrepreneur' s own savings (insider finance), bank borrowing, and risk capital from business angels or venture capital firms is focused upon. It is found that start-up firms financed by business angels are more likely to increase sales even after controlling entrepreneur, firm, and industry characteristics. On the other hand, the use of entrepreneurs' own savings and financing from founding members and family (quasi-insider finance) negatively influence post-entry performance. In addition, it is not found that those financed by banks tend to grow.",1,train,116

11222114,"Encouraging private investment in affordable housing Australia has been recognised as a major challenge by researchers and policy-makers for some time and this has generated considerable work on possible models. One successful model of private investment in the large scale provision of rental housing has been that of Defence Housing Australia (DHA). In 2009, DHA had a portfolio of over 17,000 dwellings valued at over $7 billion that were owned by a mix of public, private individual and institutional investors. Essentially the DHA has a number of functions, it: constructs housing buys housing sells housing (to dispose of it) sells housing to investors (called non-DHA housing in this report) and leases it back on long-term leases manages tenancies maintains houses (including essential maintenance for its leaseback properties) refurbishes housing relocates tenants. The non-DHA properties are managed by the DHA for fixed periods typically up to 12 years and are on-leased to service personnel. The financial and operational parameters of this model has many features in common with intended directions for affordable housing signalled under recent national and state policies—especially plans to promote private ownership of affordable housing and to encourage larger scale housing managers, with a focus on the potential of the not-for-profit housing sector. The aim of the project is very straightforward: ‘to determine the potential lessons of the DHA model for affordable housing provision’. To address this aim, the study will consider the following specific research questions: What are the characteristics of the rental housing investment and business models operated by the DHA and how have these developed and performed across market cycles? What benchmarks can be established for key performance areas including returns to investors and asset and tenancy management? What implications can be drawn from the DHA model for the emerging affordable rental housing sector?",1,train,299

A number of researchers have investigated the effectiveness of concept mapping on student academic achievement. The main focus of these studies have been on comparing the effectiveness of concept mapping to traditional teaching practices such as the lecture method. This research, however, compares concept mapping to tutorial sheets strategy in teaching circular and rotational motion. A sample of 70 students participated in the experiment. An equivalent number of 35 students were assigned to the control and experimental group. The control group used tutorial sheets while the experimental group used concept mapping. A pre-test and post-test was administered to the two groups. A t-test was used to compare the means of the group’s test scores. The mean score for the experimental group’s post test was higher than the mean score of the control group. This showed that concept mapping was more effective than the tutorial sheet strategy.

Here, we modeled current and future snakebite risk using ecological niche models (ENMs) of 90 venomous snake taxa. Current snakebite risk predictions were corroborated by incidence data from eight regions/periods with different characteristics. Detailed projections of potential future range shifts on distributions of the medically most relevant species indicated that North American species’ ranges are likely to increase in the future, but mixed results were obtained for Latin American snakes. A likely expansion of overall risk area and an increase of rural population at risk were observed from a consensus model among future scenarios. Our study highlights the capacity of ENMs to provide detailed information on current and future potential distributions of venomous snakes, as well as useful perspectives on snakebite risk, at least broad scales.",1,train,148

These practices can be shared and learned to increase the probability of brand integration success in future M&As. The paper adopts the case-study method by interviewing several top-level executives, M&A managers, functional managers and members of M&A projects which have been involved in M&As. Twenty practices are outlined and defined after analysing ten M&A events within six case companies (which are multinational corporations – MNCs). The paper provides managers with insights into good (or winning) practices that MNCs have adopted in integrating brands in their M&As by addressing a number of specific issues and corresponding solutions. The twenty practices for the integration of brands in M&As are classified into eight major clusters according to the dimensions of brand and brand management these practices are related to – brand strategic positioning, brand people, brand knowledge transfer, brand integration planning, brand integration implementation, brand disposal expertise, brand disposal negotiation, and brand due diligence. These clusters allow M&A and integration managers to accumulate their own brand integration practices from time to time systematically.

155900049,"ICWA is one of the foundational laws of federal Indian law, but it usually arises in the broader public consciousness when there is a voluntary adoption subject to the law. Recently, the law was subject to Supreme Court review in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. A heart-wrenching case, but ICWA is far more regularly applied in abuse and neglect cases. Any involuntary removal of an American Indian child, as defined by the Act, requires the application of ICWA. While cases of voluntary adoptions designed to thwart the requirements of ICWA require constant vigilance from states and tribes, the law provides broader protections for those families in the state child welfare system. This article posits one way to both collect data about abuse and neglect compliance within the framework of ICWA, and increase that compliance through collaborative change to the systems. QUICWA, a project by the Minneapolis American Indian Center, consists of a group of interested stakeholders who have created a checklist to measure what happens in each individual hearing where the court must apply ICWA. While other groups, such as the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, use a different checklist format, the goal of the projects are similar — to find ways to increase compliance with ICWA. Funded in collaboration with Casey Family Programs, law schools and social work programs in key states have started observing ICWA hearings using the QUICWA checklist.

In two experiments, we demonstrated that a Black male drive-by shooter’s level of phenotypic stereotypicality is accurately identified by eyewitnesses only when the victims are Black males. Specifically, when eyewitnesses believe the victims are White or female, the drive-by shooter’s level of Black phenotypic stereotypicality is falsely elevated.

However an understanding of the use and barriers to nutrition and psychological injury prevention strategies is not currently known. This information may prove useful in the multidisciplinary environment of elite sport. Objective The objective of this study was to understand the use of exercise, nutrition and psychology injury prevention strategies, identify barriers/facilitators to implementation and preferred methods of knowledge dissemination to athletes. Design An online survey was developed based upon theories of behaviour change and injury surveillance in multi-sport event guidelines. Setting Elite (International/National standard) athletes from a variety of sports. Participants Athletes were randomly recruited from (n=50). Assessment of Risk Factors Athletes completed a questionnaire assessing risk perceptions, prevention beliefs, injury prevention strategy use, injury location/type target, outcome expectancies, barriers/facilitators to injury strategy use and current/preferred channels of information dissemination. Main Outcome Measurements Exercise, nutrition and psychology injury prevention strategy use and barriers/facilitators to strategy use. Results Preliminary findings indicate athletes did not engage with any evidence-based multi-component injury prevention programmes but the majority of athletes reported using at least one exercise-based strategy (97% of athletes) and nutrition-based strategy (97%), but fewer athletes used at least one psychology-based strategy (75%). The most common barriers reported by athletes were a lack of relative advantage for exercise-based strategies and poor how-to-knowledge, principles-knowledge and trialability particularly for nutrition and psychology-based strategies. The most common facilitators were similar across all three injury prevention strategies. These were a performance benefit, injury prevention benefit, relevance, awareness-knowledge, and usefulness. Conclusions No athletes engaged with an evidence-based injury prevention program but many used at least one exercise, nutrition or psychology injury prevention strategy.

152364019,"Informational privacy is the ability to determine for yourself when and how others may collect and use your information. Adequate informational privacy requires a sufficiently broad ability to give or withhold free and informed consent to proposed uses.Notice and Choice (sometimes also called “notice and consent”) is the current paradigm for consent online. The Notice is a presentation of terms, typically in a privacy policy or terms of use agreement. The Choice is an action signifying acceptance of the terms, typically clicking on an “I agree” button, or simply using the website. Recent reports by the Federal Trade Commission explicitly endorse the Notice and Choice approach (and provide guidelines for its implementation). When the Notice contains information about data collection and use, the argument for Notice and Choice rests on two claims. First: a fully adequate implementation of the paradigm would ensure that website visitors can give free and informed consent to data collection and use practices. Second: the combined effect of all the individual decisions is an acceptable overall tradeoff between privacy and the benefits of collecting and using consumers’ data. There are (we contend) decisive critiques of both claims. So why do policy makers and privacy advocates continue to endorse Notice and Choice?Most likely, they see no need to seek an alternative. We find the critique of Notice and Choice conclusive, but our assessment is far from widely shared — and understandably so. Criticisms of Notice and Choice are scattered over several articles and books. No one has unified them and answered the obvious counterarguments. We do so. Making the critique plain, however, is not enough to ensure that policy makers turn to a viable alternative. The critiques are entirely negative; they do not offer any alternative to Notice and Choice. We offer an alternative: informational norms. When appropriate informational norms govern online data collection and use, they both ensure that visitors give free and informed consent to those practices, and yield an acceptable overall tradeoff between protecting privacy and the benefits of processing information. A fundamental difficulty is the lack of norms. Rapid advances in information processing technology have fueled new business models, and the rapid development has outpaced the slow evolution of norms. Notice and Choice cannot be pressed into service to remedy this lack. It is necessary to develop new norms.",0,train,386

Traditionally, the benefits of an urban rail line are calculated on the basis of user benefits such as savings in travel time, vehicle operating costs, accident costs and environmental costs, and more recently wider economic benefits. An alternative approach that is sometimes used is to consider the appreciation of property prices along a rail corridor, and the intensification of land development surrounding a rail station. Using the development of new rail lines in Singapore as a case study, this paper will first apply the hedonic regression method to obtain estimates of elasticity between property price and transport accessibility. Secondly, using historical land use masterplans, the paper will discuss how the density of land use adjacent to rail stations has intensified over the past 15 years, through a comparative analysis of the land use density with respect to the distance to a rail station. Finally, with the North East Line as an example, the alternative approach comprising the land value enhancement of existing properties and the land intensification due to proximity to the line will be compared against the conventional user benefits.",1,train,205

We address here two main questions: (1) How do we solve the issue of the subjectivity in the evaluation of data and results, which may be particularly critical for read-across, but may have a role also for the QSAR assessment? (2) How do we take advantage of the results of both approaches to support each other? The QSAR model starts from the training set. The presence of similar chemicals with property values close to that predicted can support the result. The approach in read-across is the opposite. The assessment is focused on the few substances similar to the target. The data quality of the similar chemicals is fundamental. A risk is poor standardization in the definition of 'similarity', because different approaches may be applied. Inspired by the principles of high transparency and reproducibility, a new program for read-across, called ToxRead, has been developed and made freely available ( www.toxgate.eu ).

55601863,"This paper looks at identifying factors affecting forecasting decision making in the supply chain of a government owned corporation (GOC), and how a recent Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) implementation was perceived with respect to the usability of the forecasting modules available. It is argued that GOCs represent a distinct form of organisation and that ERP implementation strategies may need to modify some of their basic assumptions in order to be successful. The research approach used was a case study as this was seen as the most appropriate to uncovering the deeper issues which may be unique to GOCs. The study consisted of two major steps. The first step identified 31 key personal in the supply chain and these people were interviewed to determine the level of need for decision support tools prior to the implementation of a new ERP. The second step of the research involved conducting interviews with16 of the original 31 staff and this was done after the ERP had been implemented for over a year. The feasibility of improving forecasting through the use of decision support system (DSS) and the degree to which the technology can assist forecasting in the supply chain was then explored. It was discovered that data accuracy was a problem. This was not associated with the ERP implementation, but rather with social factors such as different preferences among groups of staff on how to configure procurement and payment of invoices resulting in a lack of a consistent approach across the entire GOC. A lack of trust in the ERP and ineffective training methods were also identified. This research suggests that ERP implementations within GOC's, in particular those with an extensive distributed network such as transport and electricity, are special cases and should be treated differently to implementations in other industries. Further research studies are needed to determine if ERP implementation in GOCs represent a distinct population with special requirements.",1,train,317

The conflict among these four principles is particularly evident in the display of spatially explicit data through maps combined with the sharing of tabular data files. This paper reviews these two research activities and shows how current practices favor one of the principles over the others and do not satisfactorily resolve the conflict among them. Maps are indispensable for the display of results but also reveal information on the location of respondents and sampling clusters that can then be used in combination with shared data files to identify respondents.

Here, a critical overview of soft robotic grippers is presented, covering different material sets, physical principles, and device architectures. Soft gripping can be categorized into three technologies, enabling grasping by: a) actuation, b) controlled stiffness, and c) controlled adhesion. A comprehensive review of each type is presented. Compared to rigid grippers, end-effectors fabricated from flexible and soft components can often grasp or manipulate a larger variety of objects. Such grippers are an example of morphological computation, where control complexity is greatly reduced by material softness and mechanical compliance. Advanced materials and soft components, in particular silicone elastomers, shape memory materials, and active polymers and gels, are increasingly investigated for the design of lighter, simpler, and more universal grippers, using the inherent functionality of the materials. Embedding stretchable distributed sensors in or on soft grippers greatly enhances the ways in which the grippers interact with objects. Challenges for soft grippers include miniaturization, robustness, speed, integration of sensing, and control. Improved materials, processing methods, and sensing play an important role in future research.",0,train,187

Four hypotheses were analysed using hierarchical and stepwise regression analysis. The results revealed that age cohort variables made significant contribution to financial planning preparation as well as personal orientation towards retirement planning, particularly the younger age cohort. Age cohorts do affect personal orientation towards retirement planning with the confidence level making a significant impact. Current financial resources do have a strong positive impact on consumption for all age cohorts. On the other hand, no significant effect was found between age cohorts and current financial resources but older age cohorts were relatively more significant predictors.",1,train,116
32552444,"Background: Female-breadwinner families represent a relatively new phenomenon in Europe. Little is known about the determinants of this couple type, which sensibly diverts from the traditional economic superiority of men within the household. Objective: This paper studies the contextual correlates of partners’ contribution to the household income, distinguishing between female-breadwinner, male-breadwinner, and equal-income couples. In particular, it focuses on the role of male unemployment rate and the prevalence of gender-egalitarian attitudes as possible explanations for the emergence of female-breadwinner and equal-income couples across European regions and countries. Methods: Using data from the fifth round (2010/2011) of the European Social Survey, integrated with data from the Eurostat database, we model the categorical variable identifying the couple type (male-breadwinner, female-breadwinner, or equal-income couple) by using a multilevel multinomial logistic regression model where individuals are nested within regions and countries. Results: The prevalence of female-breadwinner, male-breadwinner, and equal-income couples varies considerably across European countries as well as within countries. The prevalence of female-breadwinner couples is positively associated with male unemployment, while it is not influenced by the diffusion of gender-egalitarian attitudes. However, the diffusion of gender-egalitarian attitudes matters for explaining the variation in the prevalence of equal-income couples across Europe. Contribution: We add to the literature on partners’ contributions to household income by analysing the spatial distribution and the contextual correlates of female-breadwinner, male-breadwinner, and equal-income couples across European countries and regions.",1,train,229
36656707,"Abstract This paper investigates theoretically how the structure of means-tested public long-term care (LTC) support influences the relationship between LTC insurance and informal care. Three types of public support encountered in various means-tested LTC schemes are examined. First, the level to be considered for means-testing only takes into account the level of wealth of the recipient without considering the cost of LTC or the possible insurance benefits. Second, the public support also considers the LTC needs of the recipient. Third, the means-test structure takes into consideration insurance benefits as well. Our results show that the optimal levels of insurance and informal care as well as their relationship are strongly influenced by the ways means-tested public support for LTC is structured, which have important implications in terms of public policy for the financing of LTC needs.",1,train,135

Meanwhile, we constructed artificial islet tissue by compound culturing the pancreatic stem cells and the fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane and explored the function of artificial islets in diabetic nude mice. Methods Pancreatic stem cells were cultured on the fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane in dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing activin-A, β-catenin, and exendin-4. The differentiated pancreatic stem cells combined with modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane were implanted subcutaneously in diabetic nude mice. The function of artificial islet tissue was explored by detecting blood levels of glucose and insulin in diabetic nude mice. Moreover, the proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic stem cells on modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane as well as the changes on the tissue structure of artificial islets were investigated by immunofluorescence and haematoxylin and eosin staining. Results The pancreatic stem cells differentiated into islet-like cells and secreted insulin when cultured on fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane. Furthermore, when the artificial islet tissues were implanted into diabetic nude mice, the pancreatic stem cells combined with polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane modified by fibroblasts proliferated, differentiated, and secreted insulin to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic nude mice. Conclusion Pancreatic stem cells can be induced to differentiate into islet-like cells in vitro. In vivo, the artificial islet tissue can effectively regulate the blood glucose level in nude mice within a short period. However, as time increased, the structure of the artificial islets was destroyed due to the erosion of blood cells that resulted in the gradual loss of artificial islet function.",0,train,276

6551269,"Herpes Simplex keratitis (HSK), caused by Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1), is the leading cause of infectious corneal blindness in the western world [1]. Initial infection develops through ocular surface entry from droplet spread [2]. Once HSV-1 has breached the epithelial barrier of the ocular surface, it is recognized by Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), which then activate the appropriate innate immune response. Despite the high prevalence of HSV-1, only a small minority of patients develop ocular manifestations. Therefore, we hypothesized that TLR expression and activity may be deregulated in patients with HSK, which would reflect in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses observed in these patients. We investigated the effects of the TLR ligands 3, 4, 7 and 9 (as they are involved in anti-viral immune defence [3]) on cytokine induction from a patient with active HSK and compared responses of this patient to TLR ligands on a subsequent follow up visit where disease was diagnosed to be inactive.",0,train,159

This paper presents a new approach to quantify residential demand responsiveness to (time-of-use) TOU rates, which does not entail an econometric estimation of TOU demand equations. Based on one of the four smart grid pilots in China, our approach uses the survey data collected in 2011 from 236 residents in Yinchuan to implement a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the minimum, expected and maximum demand responsiveness to four TOU rate designs. We find that residents do not respond to TOU pricing when the TOU rate design only causes a 10% increase in their existing electricity bills under non-TOU rates. However, their estimated peak demand responsiveness is 8.41% (21.26%) when the peak-time price increases by 20% (40%). Based on these findings, we conclude that suitably designed TOU rates are useful to the efficient operation of a smart grid.",0,train,155

Psychotherapy often has been advocated as the first line in PTSD treatments, and existing interventions have been primarily based on treating individual symptoms. Nevertheless, the deleterious effects of PTSD reverberate beyond the youth; parents, caregivers, and other social influences (e.g., romantic partners) report high levels of distress due the youth’s struggles with their symptoms or due to their own feelings of guilt, shame, or helplessness. Recognizing that social agents are a significant factor in both PTSD recovery, reduction in problematic behaviors, and caregiver stress, there is a surge of PTSD treatments that have been modified to include, either directly or indirectly, social agents.

Eye-tracking is utilised at the interface between the human and the technology side of digitalisation and it is exactly at that interface, where technological innovations translate into economic values through productivity gains, increased sales, higher realised prices, improved customer satisfaction, fewer litigation cases, longer lasting customer relationships and thereby increased lifetime customer value, more profitable management decisions and improved shareholder trust. Unfortunately, numerous frictions between “machines” and humans exist at these interfaces. Over the last decades, scientists have refined methods and invented tools to detect those frictions, reflected in visual perception: eye-tracking. While the causes of these frictions are countless, eye-tracking is a single scientific method for detecting very many of them. Eye-tracking – so to speak – is “digitalisation’s best friend”.

Up to now, the distinct structure and morphology of intact and degenerate human utricular otoconia has been only poorly investigated on vital specimen. In this study, human otoconia were obtained from the utricle in five patients undergoing translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery. Specimens were examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy. Intact and degenerate otoconia as well as fracture particles of otoconia and bone were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Intact otoconia reveal a uniform size showing characteristic symmetry properties. Degenerative changes can be observed at several stages with gradual minor and major changes in their morphology including fragment formation. EDX analyses reveal the characteristic chemical composition also for otoconia remnants. XRD shows that intact and degenerate otoconia as well as remnants consist of the calcite modification. In conclusion, electron microscopy serves as a standard method for morphological investigations of otoconia. Human utricular otoconia show a uniform outer morphology corresponding to a calcite-based nanocomposite. Morphological changes provide further evidence for degeneration of utricular otoconia in humans, which might be a preconditioning factor causing BPPV.

55252549,"In civil disputes, the plaintiff must prove his case by the preponderance of the evidence. To reach this standard, the plaintiff accumulates evidence by combining facts. I compare two models of this process. Decision makers can adapt their behavior for improved results, as assumed in some psychological models. Adaptive models predict that court practice will allow the plaintiff to combine facts according to relatively simple rules. Alternatively, decision makers can optimize their behavior for best results, as assumed in most economic models. Optimization models predict that court practice will require the plaintiff to combine facts in ways that conform to the laws of probability theory. The two predictions contradict each other when simple, adaptive rules violate the laws of probability theory. I show that actual practice in a California court allows the plaintiff to combine facts according to relatively simple rules that sometimes violate the laws of probability theory. Adaptation is, consequently, a better descriptive theory than optimization. Procedures that violate the laws of probability theory, however, are vulnerable to withering criticism. Given that trials proceed with deliberate speed under expert guidance, suboptimal adaptations are irrational. Optimization, consequently, is a better normative theory than adaptation.",1,train,195

In Quebec, an increase in the number of severe iGASd cases has recently been observed. Because of the inter-individual variability in the severity of iGASd, a hereditary predisposition to invasive disease can be suspected. Given that iGASd occurs in MyD88- and IRAK4-deficient patients, although rarely, the increasing frequency of iGASd in the population of French-Canadian children may be associated with a deficiency in the host’s innate immune response.

GAS virulence factors and genotype are not implicated in the susceptibility toward iGASd, and cellular and MyD88/IRAK4 deficiencies are excluded in our patients. Although it has been shown that the MyD88/IRAK4-dependent signal is involved in the response to invasive GAS, our data indicates that a MyD88/IRAK4-mediated signalling defect is not the main factor responsible for the susceptibility to severe iGASd in a paediatric population from the province of Quebec.",0,train,201

Even in the absence of decline, however, memory is imperfect and forgetting can be especially consequential for older adults. For example, forgetting to take prescription medicines is an age-related problem largely because older adults tend to ingest many more prescription drugs.

The question addressed here is to what extent neighbourhood characteristics (percentage of rented dwellings, low-income households, and ethnic minorities in the neighbourhood) influence different categories of residents to wish to leave their neighbourhood. The answer to this question can enhance our understanding of residential mobility and of the mechanisms causing segregation by income and ethnic groups. We use data from the 2002 Netherlands Housing Demand Survey, enriched with neighbourhood characteristics. Whether or not people wish to leave their neighbourhood is estimated using a multilevel logistic regression model with cross-level interaction effects between individual and neighbourhood characteristics. The main result shows that, with an increasing percentage of people from an ethnic minority in the neighbourhood, more people have the wish to leave the neighbourhood. However, this is to a lesser extent the case for members of ethnic minorities themselves.",1,train,162
168260833,"In April 2016, a massive leak of confidential legal documents, now known as the “Panama Papers,” attracted international scrutiny and condemnation of offshore asset protection trust arrangements. Such trusts are legal to create but notoriously susceptible to abuse by wrongdoers seeking to hide assets from the peering eyes of tax collectors and creditors. The Panama Papers offer compelling evidence of something long suspected but difficult to prove for lack of transparency — even though asset-offshoring techniques may be used for legitimate purposes, they are, in fact, too often abused as a cover for criminal activity and tax evasion. In response to the leak, the U.S. Department of Justice and several foreign law enforcement agencies opened investigations into the financial improprieties uncovered by the Panama Papers. However, before criticizing offshore trust havens for capitalizing on fraudulent behavior at the expense of nonresident claimants, U.S. state lawmakers should first reflect upon the recent wave of domestic trust legislation authorizing similar conduct here at home. This Piece is a patriotic catharsis lamenting the recent trend of U.S. trust law to sanitize some of the most controversial and widely abused offshore trust practices and urges lawmakers to take steps toward its reversal. Three aspects of U.S. trust law, in particular, have authorized asset protection techniques similar to those permitted in offshore trust havens: (1) self-settled asset protection trusts, (2) nonresident tax shelters, and (3) trust secrecy. The Piece concludes with a discussion of existing federal law protections against domestic trust abuse and recommendations for reform.",0,train,251

In this paper we describe our experience running an NSF-sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Computer Science and Engineering (CS&E), an area where these problems have been recently exacerbated and where under-represented minority student groups with important growth rates have had a very low participation. The most important aspects that need to be included in these programs to address these concerns and some other initiatives that can bring additional benefits at low cost are also described. For each of these aspects, successful strategies or best practices are included. Finally, the effectiveness of the program is demonstrated with the results of the program evaluation. 1.

One tactic for reducing peak loads is to increase the responsiveness of demand to changes in wholesale electricity prices. This research describes the Computer-Aided Home Energy Management (CAHEM) system, which integrates consumer preferences and real-time information about electricity prices, loads, and weather into a load-shifting algorithm that seeks an optimal tradeoff between residential electricity consumer satisfaction and peak load reduction using a rule-based fuzzy controller. We evaluate the effects of the CAHEM system on the larger power system, using PJM data from 1999, and then use the CAHEM system as the basis of a model of consumer response that we embed in a larger multi-agent simulation (MAS) of the electricity market. We focus on characteristics germane to the reliability of the transmission system, particularly price spike behavior and capacity availability and utilization. Because our fndings suggest that strategic suppliers reduce their offers in response to increased consumer price-responsiveness, we cast some doubt upon assumptions that more consumer flexibility will necessarily increase the reliability of the system as a whole.",1,train,180

We aimed to assess and compare geometric accuracy of preclinical scanners and examine the longitudinal stability of one scanner using a simple quality assurance (QA) protocol. Six 7 Tesla animal scanners across six different preclinical imaging centers throughout Europe were used to scan a small structural phantom and estimate linear scaling errors in all orthogonal directions and volumetric errors. Between-scanner imaging consisted of a standard sequence and each center’s preferred sequence for the assessment of infarct size in rat models of stroke. The standard sequence was also used to evaluate the drift in accuracy of the worst performing scanner over a period of six months following basic gradient calibration. Scaling and volumetric errors using the standard sequence were less variable than corresponding errors using different stroke sequences. The errors for one scanner, estimated using the standard sequence, were very high (above 4% scaling errors for each orthogonal direction, 18.73% volumetric error). Calibration of the gradient coils in this system reduced scaling errors to within ±1.0%; these remained stable during the subsequent 6-month assessment. In conclusion, despite decades of use in experimental studies, preclinical MRI still suffers from poor and variable geometric accuracy, influenced by the use of miscalibrated systems and various types of sequences for the same purpose. For effective pooling of data in multicenter studies, centers should adopt standardized procedures for system QA and in vivo imaging.",1,train,268

It traces the influence of particular individuals (e.g., Charles Clark in the United States, and Harry Woolf in England) in the use of empirical studies of litigation patterns and court rules to effectuate legal reforms. The essay reviews some particularly contentious issues over time, such as whether there is/was too much or too little litigation, access to courts, discovery practices, evaluations of the effects of particular rules, such as Rule 11 verification requirements, class actions, and practices such as court use of ADR, case management, and pre-trial conferences. The authors argue that empirical research on procedures and policies in courts have mostly been conducted in service of particular reform agendas, with a few exceptions of more ""pure academic"" study. The essay concludes with some suggestions for research questions that explore questions of who does the research for what purposes. Do researchers use research to develop their own ""human capital"" or legal reform influence? How do we know what optimal rates of court usage are?

Diet formulation employing a static linear programming (LP) approach, which is widely used in trading firms and feed production facilities, does not allow for intertemporal flexibility. Our approach allows the interaction between feed components over time, considering the volatile global feed prices, thereby improving sustainability in feed formulation and feed availability. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop a multi-stage LP feed model, (2) demonstrate its potential use in broiler feeding, and (3) illustrate the impact of feed input price spread (variation) on the composition of broiler diets. Modeling resulted in reciprocal relationships between conventional feeds and byproducts at different rates. Based on the price spreads expressed as a percentage of DDGS (distiller’s dried grains with solubles) price compared to corn price, three positions of dietary switch were identified; corn-DDGS price spreads of higher than 94%, between 76 and 94%, and lower than 76% corresponding to limited/no inclusion, partial inclusion, and maximum replacement of corn by DDGS, respectively. Rapeseed meal inclusion was 4, 5, and 6% in the corn-based starter, grower, and finisher diets, respectively, and its potential to replace soybean meal was limited by its higher fiber content.

Although bladder-preserving surgery can be used to treat NMIBC, the rate of recurrence remains high. Intravesical chemotherapy has been shown to reduce the rate of NMIBC recurrence, and mitomycin C (MMC) has become the most commonly used intravesical cytotoxic agent. Despite the popularity of this agent in the treatment of NMIBCs, many questions regarding the optimal approach to MMC therapy remain unanswered. Strategies to enhance delivery of MMC have been well studied and multiple measures are recommended for implementation in routine clinical practice. In addition, less widely investigated techniques, such as hyperthermia and electromotive drug administration, have been shown to increase the efficacy of MMC therapy. Nevertheless, even when the current 'optimal' approaches to MMC administration are used, a large proportion of NMIBCs recur. This apparent treatment resistance might be overcome by combination of MMC with other agents that have different mechanisms of action and are unlikely to have cross-resistance. Study of the mechanisms of resistance is, therefore, important to identify key pathways underlying this phenomenon, which could be rationally targeted using specific combinations of drugs. Knowledge of these mechanisms might also reveal markers of responsiveness to therapy that could be used for patient selection.",1,train,208

In this paper regulatory barriers for an economically efficient energy storage deployment are presented and evaluated using a generic optimization model for a multifunctional operation of storage technologies on electricity markets capable to consider different market and regulatory design changes. Due to the rising significance of grid restrictions for the integration of intermittent resources and upcoming new innovative storage technologies on distribution grid level, the electricity grid was integrated into the model.

Yet, these two accounts have never been systematically tested against each other, nor have their predictive powers been examined across different measures of the public’s risk perception. In two studies, we gauged risk perception in student samples by employing three measures (frequency, value of a statistical life, and perceived risk) and by using a homogeneous (cancer) and a classic set of heterogeneous causes of death. Based on these judgments of risk, we tested precise models of the availability heuristic and the affect heuristic and different definitions of availability and affect. Overall, availability-by-recall, a heuristic that exploits people’s direct experience of occurrences of risks in their social network, conformed to people’s responses best. We also found direct experience to carry a high degree of ecological validity (and one that clearly surpasses that of affective information). However, the relative impact of affective information (as compared to availability) proved more pronounced in value-of-a-statistical-life and perceived-risk judgments than in riskfrequency judgments. Encounters with risks in the media, in contrast, played a negligible role in people’s judgments.

161051797,"Abstract We conduct experiments eliciting risk preferences with over 1,400 children and adolescents aged 3–15 years old. We complement our data with an assessment of cognitive and executive function skills. First, we find that adolescent girls display significantly greater risk aversion than adolescent boys. This pattern is not observed among young children, suggesting that the gender gap in risk preferences emerges in early adolescence. Second, we find that at all ages in our study, cognitive skills (specifically math ability) are positively associated with risk taking. Executive functions among children, and soft skills among adolescents, are negatively associated with risk taking. Third, we find that greater risk-tolerance is associated with higher likelihood of disciplinary referrals, which provides evidence that our task is equipped to measure a relevant behavioral outcome. For academics, our research provides a deeper understanding of the developmental origins of risk preferences and highlights the important role of cognitive and executive function skills to better understand the association between risk preferences and cognitive abilities over the studied age range.",1,train,170

This article analyses partisan impact on refugee immigration to Norway.The first part maps party positions on refugee immigration and demonstrates that the views of Norwegian parties are far from consensual. The second part tests whether the number of refugees admitted has been affected by changes of government by way of a panel analysis covering the period 1985‐2005 and 143 sending countries. Controlling for other determinants of immigration both in receiving and sending countries, the analysis suggests that that the number of refugees admitted to Norway has been significantly lower during Conservative rule.Among parties with government experience, the Conservative Party also has adopted the most restrictive stand in its manifestoes. No significant differences between Labour Party and centre governments were found, even though the centre parties express more liberal preferences.",1,train,136
146544231,"We propose a mediation model to explain the relationship between CEO humility and firm performance. Building on upper echelons, power, and paradox theories, we hypothesize that when a more humble CEO leads a firm, its top management team (TMT) is more likely to collaborate, share information, jointly make decisions, and possess a shared vision. The firm will also tend to have lower pay disparity between the CEO and the TMT. The humble CEO and TMT, in turn, will be more likely to adopt an ambidextrous strategic orientation, which will be associated with stronger firm performance. We tested the model by using both survey and archival data that were collected at multiple time points from 105 small-to-medium-sized firms in the computer software and hardware industry in the United States. Findings largely support our theoretical assertions, suggesting that CEO humility has important implications for firm processes and outcomes.",1,train,146
154816582,"Summary A systematic calibration procedure is described for incorporating more than one risk model in a portfolio construction strategy. The addition of a second risk model can lead to just as conservative portfolios and better overall performance than one risk model alone provided that the strategy is calibrated so that both risk models affect the optimal portfolio solution. We report results using Axioma’s Japanese risk models and two risk constraints in the portfolio construction strategy. In all cases, Axioma’s daily fundamental factor Japanese risk model is the primary risk model which is used to define the tracking error of the portfolio, the primary risk constraint in the strategy. Three different second risk model constraints are considered: a) Constrain active risk using Axioma’s statistical factor risk model. b) Constrain total risk using Axioma’s statistical factor risk model. c) Constrain specific risk using Axioma’s fundamental factor risk model. Calibration of the portfolio construction parameters is essential since the region over which both risk models affect the solution is difficult to predict a priori and can be relatively narrow. In many cases, calibration results give a clear, optimum set of portfolio construction parameters in which the second risk model synergistically improves portfolio performance.",1,train,200

Methods: A retrospective interventional study was conducted reviewing our database for patients with a diagnosis of endophthalmitis in the course of anti-VEGF injections. Endophthalmitis diagnosis was made on clinical examination of pain, rapid decrease in visual acuity (VA), conjunctival hyperemia, hypopyon, and vitritis. In all eyes, core vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics was performed. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was performed monthly before and after surgery during follow-up. Anti-VEGF injections were continued after surgery in all cases. Results: Eight eyes with postinjection endophthalmitis were included. Mean VA immediately before endophthalmitis was 20/50 Snellen with a mean of 19 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (P = .45). At time of endophthalmitis diagnosis, mean VA was 20/1000 (range, 20/2000-20/200). Mean time from injection to when the patient noted first symptoms was 4.3 days (range, 1-8 days). Mean time from first symptoms to surgery was 12 hours (range, 2.5-26 hours). Final mean VA at the end of follow-up (range, 12-84 months) did not statistically differ from VA at the visit immediately before endophthalmitis diagnosis (P = .69). Mean frequency of injections after vitrectomy did not significantly differ from the presurgical course of treatment (P =.97). Conclusions: Anti-VEGF treatment might be continued after vitrectomy for endophthalmitis and results in satisfactory anatomical and visual outcome. Surgery did not influence the frequency of anti-VEGF injections for neovascular AMD.",1,train,250

892290,"The standard argument for abstracting from capital accumulation in sticky-price macro models is based on their short-run focus: over this horizon, capital does not move much. This argument is more problematic in the context of real exchange rate (RER) dynamics, which are very persistent. In this paper we study RER dynamics in sticky-price models with capital accumulation. We analyze both a model with an economy-wide rental market for homogeneous capital, and an economy in which capital is sector specific. We find that, in response to monetary shocks, capital increases the persistence and reduces the volatility of RERs. Nevertheless, versions of the multisector sticky-price model of Carvalho and Nechio (2011) augmented with capital accumulation can match the persistence and volatility of RERs seen in the data, irrespective of the type of capital. When comparing the implications of capital specificity, we find that, perhaps surprisingly, switching from economy-wide capital markets to sector-specific capital tends to decrease the persistence of RERs in response to monetary shocks. Finally, we study how RER dynamics are affected by monetary policy and find that the source of interest rate persistence -- policy inertia or persistent policy shocks -- is key.",1,train,193
511955,"Genius and madness have long been thought to be intimately entwined. However, the idea remains controversial: some rail against the stereotype of the mad scientist or the crazy artist (e.g., Schlesinger, 2009, 2012), while others note higher incidences of mental illness amongst creative geniuses, including prize-winning authors, visual artists, and poets (e.g., Andreasen, 1987; Kaufman, 2000-2001; Nettle, 2006). Consistent with early ideas of a shared genetic basis (e.g., Lombroso, 1891; Galton, 1892), a growing body of research highlights a positive correlation between mental illness and heightened creativity (e.g., Rothenberg, 2001). The relationship between creativity and schizotypy warrants close examination, as greater creativity is associated with higher levels of schizotypal traits (e.g., Folley and Park, 2005). Atypical brain lateralization may play the causal role, being evident in people who are highly creative and in people who have high levels of schizotypal traits (e.g., Weinstein and Graves, 2002). This paper argues in favor of the opinion that atypical lateralization prompts a cognitive processing style that enhances both creativity and schizotypy, suggesting a potential biological foundation for the link between genius and madness.",1,train,180

In nominal metaphors, such as ""My lawyer is a shark,"" the metaphor vehicle ""shark"" refers to an abstract category of predatory creatures, not to the basic-level concept, the literal fish we call ""shark."" People can use the level of abstraction of the metaphor vehicle (shark) as a cue that the expression is intended metaphorically rather than literally (Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990). Can the metaphorical use of verbs, as in ""he hopped on his bike and flew home"" be recognized in the same way? We investigated whether the level of abstraction of a verb's referent provides a cue that the verb is used metaphorically rather than literally. We varied level of abstraction of verb use, and obtained judgments of metaphoricity as a function of abstraction level. As with nouns, verbs that are understood at a higher level of abstraction are rated as more metaphorical than when the same verbs could be interpreted at the basic (literal) level.

Put another way, although those who defended traditional marriage were wrong with respect to their agenda, what if they in fact were absolutely right in that the marital relationship can provide something quite distinct and of great societal value? After analyzing this proposition, this essay proposes a rethinking of the privacy doctrine. What if the right to be let alone — the prior means by which the citizen is best protected by the State — is in fact more harmful than helpful?

Higher ethanol production and lower ethanol prices have proven quite effective in the past at maintaining ethanol's place in gasoline blends and are likely to continue to do so in the future.” Here, we take up the topic again because crude oil and wholesale gasoline prices continued to decline through November, with crude oil prices (WTI) reaching the lowest levels in over 5 years, while ethanol prices continued to move higher.

The second one underlies the goal to gain some social, academic or economic reward through L2 achievement which suggests a functional purpose of the target language learning. The second questionnaire section targeted the willingness and actual participation of students inside the classroom. Two variables were taken into account, the gender and the proficiency level of the subjects. Results show that almost all the respondents have an intrinsic/integrative motivation orientation, a fact that has a noticeable positive effect on their classroom participation.

To cope with the rising public importance of sustainability is a big challenge for all animal farmers and more industrialized operations especially. Confined animal farming operations (CAFO) are seen very critical by many consumers with regard to their sustainability performance, however, the need to improve the sustainability performance especially in the ecological and social dimension exists at both ends of the intensity, i.e., also for the small holder and family owned animal farming models. As in livestock operations, feed and manure contribute the majority to the three most critical environmental impact categories global warming potential (GWP), acidification (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP) any effort for improvement should start there. Intelligent combination of nutrient-, emission- and waste management in an integrated low emission farm (LEF) concept not only significantly reduces the environmental footprint in the ecological dimension of sustainability, but by producing renewable energy (heat, electricity, biomethane) with animal manure as major feedstock in an anaerobic digester also the economic dimension can be improved. Model calculations using new software show the ecological improvement potential of low protein diets using more supplemented amino acids for the Chinese pig production. The ecological impact of producing biogas or upgraded biomethane, of further treatment of the digestate and producing defined fertilizers is discussed. Finally, the LEF concept allows the integration of an insect protein plant module which offers additional ecological and economical sustainability improvement potential in the future.

148689895,"In an attempt to clarify the behavioral differences and a dimension of the individual‟s metacognitive processes, Snyder introduced the „Self-Monitoring Theory‟ in 1974. According to the theory, individuals differ in the extent to which they control their self-presentation in social interactions. Some people can observe and control their self-presentation and expressive behaviors. Besides, they are sensitive to cues indicating what expression or behavior is appropriate in any case. This sensitivity has been called „Self-Monitoring‟ skill (Snyder, 1974). In this study the effect of setting „Self-Monitoring‟ strategies during and after the Social Studies course on self-monitoring, self-regulation and academic achievement levels of the students has been investigated. In the present study, a mixed methods approach was taken, and an experimental design with pre-test and post-test and control group was used in the study.

The optical load cell applied in ice monitoring systems is immune to electromagnetic interference and has no need of a power supply on site. Therefore, it has become a hot research topic in China and other countries. In this paper, to solve the problem of eccentric load in measurement, we adopt the shearing structure with additional grooves to improve the strain distribution and acquire good repeatability. Then, the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with a permanent weldable package are mounted onto the front/rear groove of the elastic element by spot welding, the direction deviation of FBGs is 90° from each other to achieve temperature compensation without an extra FBG. After that, protection parts are designed to guarantee high sensitivity for a light load condition and industrial safety under a heavy load up to 65 kN. The results of tension experiments indicate that the sensitivity and resolution of the load cell is 0.1285 pm/N and 7.782 N in the conventional measuring range (0–10 kN). Heavy load tension experiments prove that the protection structure works and the sensitivity and resolution are not changed after several high load (65 kN) cycles. In addition, the experiment shows that the resolution of the sensor is 87.79 N in the large load range, allowing the parameter to be used in heavy icing monitoring.",1,train,239

8197919,"An algorithm for recognizing banknotes is required in many fields, such as banknote-counting machines and automatic teller machines (ATM). Due to the size and cost limitations of banknote-counting machines and ATMs, the banknote image is usually captured by a one-dimensional (line) sensor instead of a conventional two-dimensional (area) sensor. Because the banknote image is captured by the line sensor while it is moved at fast speed through the rollers inside the banknote-counting machine or ATM, misalignment, geometric distortion, and non-uniform illumination of the captured images frequently occur, which degrades the banknote recognition accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose a new method for recognizing banknotes. The experimental results using two-fold cross-validation for 61,240 United States dollar (USD) images show that the pre-classification error rate is 0%, and the average error rate for the final recognition of the USD banknotes is 0.114%.",1,train,141

Even as it erodes privacy, it fails to learn from the lessons of the Arar and Iaccobucci commissions of inquiry about the injustice that may stem from poorly governed information sharing.The claims in the government’s backgrounder that the existing accountability institutions, including the Privacy Commissioner, are up to the task is not convincing to anyone familiar with the Arar report.",1,train,234
25753499,"We describe an approach in which protein microarrays are produced using a two-dimensional (2-D) liquid phase fractionation of cell lysates. The method involves a pI-based fractionation using chromatofocusing in the first dimension followed by nonporous reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of each pI fraction in the second dimension. This allows fractionation of cellular proteins in the liquid phase that could then be arrayed on nitrocellulose slides and used to study humoral response in cancer. Protein microarrays have been used to identify potential serum biomarkers for prostate cancer. It is shown that specific fractions are immunoreactive against prostate cancer serum but not against serum from healthy individuals. These proteins could serve as sero-diagnostic markers for prostate cancer. Importantly, this method allows for use of post-translationally modified proteins as baits for detection of humoral response. Proteins eliciting an immune response are identified using the molecular mass and peptide sequence data obtained using mass spectrometric analysis of the liquid fractions. The fractionation of proteins in the liquid phase make this method amenable to automation.",1,train,171

Focusing on the central research question – whether US students learn effectively when left to their own devices while abroad, or whether students perform better when educators proactively intervene in their learning – the paper identifies a series of program design elements and learner characteristics that are significantly associated with gains in intercultural learning abroad. The Georgetown Consortium study provides significant evidence that most students benefit through enrolling in programs abroad that are intentionally designed to promote their intercultural learning (that is, programs that feature key design features that are strongly associated with student learning). In documenting important gender‐based learning differences (as measured by the pre‐ and post‐test Intercultural Development Inventory, the study’s male students made no more progress in their intercultural learning than did control students at campuses back in the US, while female students did show significant gains), the study also argues that focusing intentionally on learning abroad is especially important for male students.",1,train,186

Considering that substance dependence is one of the most stigmatizing health conditions, this study aims to assess self-stigma among crack, alcohol, and both substances (crack and alcohol) dependents. The instruments used were: 1) sociodemographic questionnaire to describe participants’ characteristics; the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale adapted for substance users to assess self-stigma; 3) MINI to confirm the substance dependence diagnosis. The sample was composed by 461 patients divided into three groups: 165 alcohol dependents, 141 crack dependents, and 155 crack and alcohol dependents. Most participants were male (91.4%), unemployed (68.6%), and single (70.5%), with incomplete elementary school education (53.3%), with a mean age of 35.38 years. Regarding to involvement in illicit activities, 56.8% stated they were not involved with this type of activity. Comparing self-stigma among the groups investigated, it was found a significant difference between the groups regarding the ISMI overall scores. Similarly, ISMI subscales Alienation, Discrimination Experience, Social Withdrawal and Stigma Resistance also showed a significant difference between groups. On the other hand, the degree of agreement with stereotypes measured by the Stereotype Endorsement subscale did not differ between the groups investigated. The negatives stereotypes associated with substance dependence are equally endorsed and internalized by all groups, however this study showed evidence that crack dependents internalize more negative evaluations related to their condition, and therefore are less likely to seek treatment and adhere to it. The results pointed out the need to consider the impact of stigma on prevention and treatment strategies, in order to encourage patients to seek help and ensure the benefits of interventions.

3521476,"A proper immune response ensures survival in a hostile environment and promotes longevity. Recent evidence indicates that innate immunity, beyond antimicrobial effectors, also relies on host-defensive mechanisms. The Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor SKN-1 regulates xenobiotic and oxidative stress responses and contributes to longevity, however, its role in immune defense is unknown. Here we show that SKN-1 is required for C. elegans pathogen resistance against both Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. Exposure to P. aeruginosa leads to SKN-1 accumulation in intestinal nuclei and transcriptional activation of two SKN-1 target genes, gcs-1 and gst-4. Both the Toll/IL-1 Receptor domain protein TIR-1 and the p38 MAPK PMK-1 are required for SKN-1 activation by PA14 exposure. We demonstrate an early onset of immunosenescence with a concomitant age-dependent decline in SKN-1-dependent target gene activation, and a requirement of SKN-1 to enhance pathogen resistance in response to longevity-promoting interventions, such as reduced insulin/IGF-like signaling and preconditioning H2O2 treatment. Finally, we find that wdr-23(RNAi)-mediated constitutive SKN-1 activation results in excessive transcription of target genes, confers oxidative stress tolerance, but impairs pathogen resistance. Our findings identify SKN-1 as a novel regulator of innate immunity, suggests its involvement in immunosenescence and provide an important crosstalk between pathogenic stress signaling and the xenobiotic/oxidative stress response.",0,train,208

Common gains of genetic sequences were observed in 3q (50.0%), 1q (42.4%), 19q (23.1%), while losses were frequently found in 11q (30.8%), 4q (23.1%) and 13q (19.2%). Chromosomal regions involved in loss of heterozygosity were observed in 15.4% of samples in 8q21, 11q23, 14q21 and 18q12.2. Incidence of gain 3q was associated with HPV 16 and HPV 18 positive samples and simultaneous presence of gain 1q (P = 0.033).

Recent advances in C–H functionalization technology have begun to transform this logic, while emphasizing the importance of and challenges associated with selective alkylation at a sp3 carbon1,2. Here we describe iron-based catalysts for the enantio-, regio- and chemoselective intermolecular alkylation of sp3 C–H bonds through carbene C–H insertion. The catalysts, derived from a cytochrome P450 enzyme in which the native cysteine axial ligand has been substituted for serine (cytochrome P411), are fully genetically encoded and produced in bacteria, where they can be tuned by directed evolution for activity and selectivity. That these proteins activate iron, the most abundant transition metal, to perform this chemistry provides a desirable alternative to noble-metal catalysts, which have dominated the field of C–H functionalization1,2. The laboratory-evolved enzymes functionalize diverse substrates containing benzylic, allylic or α-amino C–H bonds with high turnover and excellent selectivity. Furthermore, they have enabled the development of concise routes to several natural products. The use of the native iron-haem cofactor of these enzymes to mediate sp3 C–H alkylation suggests that diverse haem proteins could serve as potential catalysts for this abiological transformation, and will facilitate the development of new enzymatic C–H functionalization reactions for applications in chemistry and synthetic biology.Evolved iron-containing enzymes based on cytochrome P450 achieve selective intermolecular alkylation of sp3 C–H bonds through a carbene C–H insertion strategy.",1,train,235

First, the case where the borrowing interest rate goes up with an increase in debt is examined. The model’s implications concern the significance of the levels of productivity and the initial domestic capital for the economy not being on the poverty trap but on a growth path. Second, the case where the borrowing interest rate goes up with an increase in debt/total-capital ratio is examined. The results are radically different from the first case. The economy converges to stable equilibrium, irrespective of the initial capital level.",1,train,124
33846332,"Theory suggests that management may be able to increase firm value through the strategic use of debt when facing contingent liabilities. This paper examines whether managers strategically use financial policy when facing the risk of one such liability – litigation claims. I find that greater litigation exposure leads firms to choose higher leverage. I show that this leverage increase is brought on by an active decision to repurchase shares. These repurchases appear to be financed with a combination of excess cash and short term debt as they coincide with a significant decrease in cash holdings and an increase in short term liabilities. These firms also increase their use of operating leases, which, due to their priority in bankruptcy, have similar characteristics to secured debt. Finally, the effects seem to be stronger for firms with a higher probability of bankruptcy. These results run counter to anecdotal suggestions that firms may adjust financial policy to build a war chest in anticipation of litigation and they suggest that firms use capital structure strategically to increase shareholder value.",0,train,174
5617486,"Exercise is a robust predictor of long-term success with weight loss, and research based on social cognitive theory suggests that exercise program-induced changes in self-regulation, mood, and self-efficacy transfer to improved eating. These relationships were tested in adults with morbid obesity (overall Mage = 43 years; 86% female; Mbody mass index = 45 kg/m2) participating in a 6-month treatment of cognitive-behaviorally supported exercise paired with either standard nutrition education (n = 87) or cognitive-behavioral methods for controlled eating (n = 89). Based on multiple mediation analyses, improvements in self-regulation and self-efficacy were significantly associated with increased fruit and vegetable intake and reduced body mass index (BMI). The cognitive-behavioral nutrition methods were associated with greater improvements in fruit and vegetable intake and BMI, however, within both models, complete mediation was found after simultaneous entry of changes in self-regulation, mood, and self-efficacy, and exercise volume as mediators. Only the indirect effect of change in self-regulation was a significant (or marginally significant) independent mediator. Generalization of previously identified relationships between exercise program-induced improvements in psychosocial variables and improvements in nutrition and BMI were supported for individuals with morbid obesity. Based on these relationships, implications for behavioral treatments were discussed.",1,train,196

Sequencing and characterisation of fliC was performed in the development of a molecular serotyping technique.ResultsFliC sequencing of 106 strains revealed two groups; the g-complex included those exhibiting ""g"" or ""m,t"" antigenic factors, and the non-g strains which formed a second more diverse group. Variation in fliC was characterised and sero-specific motifs identified. Furthermore, it was possible to identify differences in certain H antigens that are not detected by traditional serotyping. A rapid short sequencing assay was developed to target serotype-specific sequence motifs in fliC. The assay was evaluated for identification of H1 antigens with a panel of 55 strains.ConclusionFliC sequences were obtained for more than 100 strains comprising 29 different H1 alleles. Unique pyrosequencing profiles corresponding to the H1 component of the serotype were generated reproducibly for the 23 alleles represented in the evaluation panel. Short read sequence assays can now be used to identify fliC alleles in approximately 97% of the 50 medically most important Salmonella in England and Wales.

But many of the commonly-cited data understate retirement plan availability and participation as well as the income that retirees derive from IRA and 401(k) plans. Moreover, many observers contrast these unduly pessimistic data with a prior ""Golden Age"" of traditional pensions, when data show that most U.S. workers never participated in such plans and onerous vesting requirements prevented many from receiving substantial benefits. A perception that most Americans are falling far short of their retirement saving goals may cause policymakers to overlook targeted polices to assist the smaller number of households who truly are at risk of an inadequate income in retirement.",0,train,122
35112923,"Abstract Infantile amnesia is a major issue in memory development. For a growing body of researchers, self is probably a key-concept for this enigma. The role of the cognitive self in early declarative memory as a function of perceptual manipulation between study- and test-phase was investigated. Two recall conditions were compared: either the same color props as in the modeling phase or different color props. Twenty-four 20-month-old children were observed in a 10-min deferred imitation task with two enabling sequences. An additional control group (N = 16) ensured that imitation scores did not rely on spontaneous production of the target behaviors at this age. Children in the experimental groups were classified as early or late recognizer depending on their success or failure to the mirror test. A significant interaction was observed between color props conditions and recognizer types: only late recognizers’ memory performance was affected by the perceptual manipulation. Results suggest that cognitive self could be one of the factors contributing to the differentiation between episodic and semantic subsystems in early declarative memory by the end of the second year.",1,train,180

Recently, however, a new debate over the attorney-client privilege has arisen in the corporate context—whether to recognize a selective waiver of the attorney-client privilege where communications have been disclosed already to one government agency but not to civil litigants or other government agencies.

Most activity was in the finishing of imported unbleached and bleached cotton cloth. Spinning and weaving were of marginal significance. The high labour intensity of small-scale production, the near-absence of local raw cotton production, and competitive international markets for yarn and cloth precluded domestic production. Boom-bust cycles in international markets and unfavourable real exchange rates discouraged investment in modern spinning and weaving.

The study also aimed to use these SNPs to develop prediction models for individual training responses. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: 79 Healthy volunteers participated in the HIT program. A genome-wide association study, based on 2,391,739 SNPs, was performed to identify SNPs that were significantly associated with gains in V'O2max and knee peak torque, following 9 weeks of the HIT program. To predict two training responses, two independent SNPs sets were determined using linear regression and iterative binary logistic regression analysis. False discovery rate analysis and permutation tests were performed to avoid false-positive findings. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: To predict gains in V'O2max, 7 SNPs were identified. These SNPs accounted for 26.0 % of the variance in the increment of V'O2max, and discriminated the subjects into three subgroups, non-responders, medium responders, and high responders, with prediction accuracy of 86.1 %. For the knee peak torque, 6 SNPs were identified, and accounted for 27.5 % of the variance in the increment of knee peak torque. The prediction accuracy discriminating the subjects into the three subgroups was estimated as 77.2 %. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Novel SNPs found in this study could explain, and predict inter-individual variability in gains of V'O2max, and knee peak torque.

156756645,"This research develops a forecasting model that can predict the quantity, time and probability of product return, recyclable parts/components/materials and disposal. It adopts the Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) by translating the remanufacturing operational process into a stochastic network. This stochastic network possesses two characteristics: activities having a probability of occurrence associated with them; and time to perform an activity. Together with the GERT method, Mason's rule is applied to calculate the equivalence transfer function of the system, therefore predicting the desired outcomes. A generic eight-step process on how to implement this method in any structure of return products and remanufacturing network is provided. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the result of using GERT on forecasting printer remanufacturing outcomes. The main contribution of this research is: Instead of giving one result such as either return quantity, or time, or probability, our research can forecast three of these outcomes simultaneously, and the algorithm is generalised to be applicable to any product structure and remanufacturing network.",1,train,167
18530525,"This essay argues that technology is not valueless; that is, technology comes equipped with its own set of values. Thus, before we continue to implement instructional technology (IT), we must consider the consequences of those values for instructors as well as students. Moreover, one of the motivations behind using IT is that such techniques transcend the barriers of more traditional Socratic techniques. We argue that once we examine the most compelling arguments for IT (i.e., that it encourages discovery-based, constructive learning styles), it emerges as more Socratic than it would first appear. We maintain that IT has the potential to benefit pedagogy, but caution instructors to think critically about IT, and its implicit ideology, as well as their role of educator rather than trainer.",0,train,124
144080263,"This study investigates how different stakeholders in Norway experienced a government-initiated, large-scale policy implementation programme on Assessment for Learning (AfL). Data were collected through 58 interviews with stakeholders in charge of the policy; Ministers of Education and members of the Directorate of Education and Training in Norway, and the main actors such as municipality leaders, teachers, school leaders and students. Successful implementation of AfL processes was found in municipalities where there were dialogue and trust between the municipality level, school leaders, teachers and students and where the programme was adapted to the local context. Implementation was challenged when the policy was interpreted as a way of controlling the schools. Despite the successful implementation in some municipalities, the programme did not have any effect upon students’ learning outcome, as measured on national tests in reading and mathematics. The results are discussed in relation to how local assessment cultures with particular characteristics influence governing, accountability and trust.",1,train,155
7031749,"Firms commonly use supervisor ratings to evaluate employees when objective performance measures are unavailable. Supervisor ratings are subjective and data containing supervisor ratings typically stem from individual firm level data sets. For both these reasons, doubts persist on how useful such data are for evaluating theories in personnel economics and whether findings from such data generalize to the labor force at large. In this paper, we examine personnel data from six large companies and establish how subjective ratings, interpreted as ordinal rankings of employees within narrowly defined peer-groups, correlate with objective career outcomes. We find many similarities across firms in how subjective ratings correlate with earnings, base pay, bonuses, promotions, demotions, separations, quits and dismissals and cautiously propose these as empirical regularities.",1,train,122
25493493,"Social networks are defined as a set of actors and relationships that represent the interactions between entities in the network. Since social networks have important roles in the dissemination of information and innovation, the analysis of such networks, attracted much attention in the research area. One of the important features of social networks is community structure. So far, several methods have been proposed to detect communities, which represent the high importance of discovering communities for understanding social networks and detecting the useful and hidden patterns in the aforementioned network. However, due to extended issue of social networks and also existing the large numbers of approaches, accurate assessment of such methods are being difficult. Therefore, for survey each proposed approach in this paper, besides introducing various types of social network, suggests a classification for community detection methods based on type and nature of social networks. Using the classification presented in this paper can play an effective role in the analysis and evaluation of community detection approaches in different application domains.",1,train,169
212767558,"Maximum Oxygen Consumption (VO 2 max) is considered to be one of the most relevant indicators of the level of functional ability of the cardiorespiratory system in individuals and athletes. It is an indicator of the functional state and knowledge of the value of VO 2 max is of great importance in order to improve the functional form for athletes and recreational people, as well as in proper planning, programming and dosing activities. The aim of this study was to review the literature in order to determine whether physical exercise can improve VO 2 max in people with spinal cord injuries. The following electronic databases were used to collect the papers: KoBSON, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PEDro, DOAJ and Open J Gate. The key words that were used to find the papers are: physical exercise, VO 2 max, spinal cord injury, adaptation, training, effects, patients, intensity, aerobic, anaerobic, heart rate. Based on inclusive and exclusive criteria, eight papers were selected that met the set criteria. Analyzing the papers, only four papers examined the differences in terms of the intensity of the exercise with the goal of finding out which intensity is suitable for improving the VO 2 max value. They have found that the VO 2 max value can be enhanced by physical exercise of increased intensity (HIIT) relative to physical exercise of moderate intensity (LI).

157650011,"Some scholars argue that intra-EU labour migration improves the allocation of human capital in Europe and that labour mobility is still too low to constitute a single European labour market. Others insist that free movement of labour and services makes employment more precarious and causes wage dumping. Less attention has been given to the origins, destinations and nature of flows of posted workers, partly because data on posting are scarce. We aim to fill this gap by exploring unique posting data for Belgium. We argue that while the free movement of labour and a single European labour market have been policy goals for decades, it is the free movement of services that is shaping a hybrid single European labour market, since high levels of short-term service mobility are more significant than long-term labour migration. This is as much a phenomenon of intra-EU15 mobility as of post-accession mobility, and is set to remain more prevalent than classic free movement of labour.",0,train,160

The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)-IMRT versus the sequential boost (SEQ)-IMRT in HNC. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: A meta-analysis of 7 studies involving a total of 1049 patients was carried out to compare the treatment outcomes together with severe acute adverse effects of the SIB-IMRT versus the SEQ-IMRT in HNC patients. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Comparison of the SIB-IMRT and SEQ-IMRT showed no significant difference in the measurement of overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94; 95% confidence inerval [CI], 0.70-1.27; P = .71), progression free survival (PFS) (HR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82-1.30; P = .79), locoregional recurrence free survival (LRFS) (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65-1.47; P = .91), and distance metastasis free survival (DMFS) (HR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.50-1.53; P = .63). Moreover, there were no significant differences in adverse effect occurrence between the SIB-IMRT and SEQ-IMRT groups. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: SIB-IMRT and SEQ-IMRT can provide comparable outcomes in the treatment of patients afflicted by HNC. Both IMRT techniques were found to carry a similar risk of severe acute adverse effect. SIB-IMRT may have advantages due to its convenience and short-course of treatment; however, the optimum fractionation and prescribed dose remained unclear. Furthermore, both IMRT techniques can be advocated as the technique of choice for HNC. Treatment plan should be individualized for patients.",1,train,248

157251303,"Over the last two decades, farmers markets have been widely recognized for their contributions to local economies, support of small-scale farmers, and ability to reconnect consumers and producers of food. Farmers markets vary substantially in both the goals they set and the outcomes they achieve. By conducting a comparative analysis, this study examines whether and how market ownership influences outcomes. Additionally, our study focuses not on determining which ownership type is ""best,"" but on highlighting how markets differ, and more importantly, the limitations that need to be overcome for each type. The research uses Henry Hansmann's (1996) ownership of enterprise framework and Muhammad Yunus's (2010) social business framework to analyze whether differences in ownership lead to variations in market governance, conduct, and performance. Interviews were conducted with managers of Oregon farmers markets representing various ownership structures. Data were analyzed using the inductive thematic analysis approach to understand how ownership influences market goals and mission, general operations, and performance outcomes. The three major market ownership types, vendor-led, community-led, and subentities, have distinct benefits and challenges associated with them. Our findings indicate that vendor-led markets have strong ties back to their vendors but have weaker links to the communities that host the market and are less able to enhance the market by adding activities and pursuing additional fundraising. We found that community-led markets benefit from strong community ties and are often able to draw upon the energy and expertise of board members and volunteers. Their links back to producers depend on vendor representation on the governing body. Finally, markets that function as subentities of broader organizations have the potential for access to greater financial and managerial resources but are often relatively poorly linked to their vendors. These results provide useful insights both for those who are considering starting a market and for those who wish to improve the performance of existing markets.",1,train,310
148934753,"Introduction ::: Autism and related autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are lifelong, often severely impairing neurodevelopmental syndromes involving deficits in social relatedness, language, and behavior. There is good evidence that electroencephalographic (EEG) changes are common in children with autism and these EEG changes are considered to be signs of cerebral dysfunction. ::: Aim of the work ::: The aim of this study was to study specific EEG patterns in autism and to correlate severity of autism to EEG patterns. ::: Participants and methods ::: The study was conducted on 30 children who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for autism aged 3 years and above, and 30 siblings of them not fulfilling criteria of any pervasive developmental disorder. Participants of this study were recruited from the private centers of developmentally handicapped children, and the neuropsychiatry outpatient clinic of Alexandria University Hospital. All studied children were subjected to the following: first: full history taking and physical, neurological, and psychiatric examination for clinical assessment of ASD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Second: psychological testing using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Third: EEG for all sampled children. ::: Results ::: Prevalence of EEG abnormalities among autistic cases was 66.7%, whereas in the sibling group was 20%, which was significantly different from cases group. Generalized symmetrical spike wave complexes and focal centrotemporal spikes were the most prevalent EEG changes among autistic cases. There was a significant relationship between CARS and generalized EEG abnormalities. ::: Conclusion ::: Generalized symmetrical spike wave complexes and focal centrotemporal spikes were the most prevalent EEG changes among autistic cases. The lack of similarity between cases and sibling EEGs suggests that the epileptiform activity found in children with ASDs is more than just a familial pattern or a typical childhood finding. There was a significant relationship between CARS and generalized EEG abnormalities.",1,train,299

However, continuing artificial selection for both efficiency and rapid growth will be subject to both biological limits and animal welfare concerns. Using a novel analytical energy flow modelling approach, we predict how far such selection can go, given the biological limits of bird energy intake and partitioning of energy. We find that the biological potential for further improvements in efficiency, and hence environmental impact reduction, is minimal relative to past progress already made via artificial selection. An alternative breeding strategy to produce slower-growing birds to meet new welfare standards increases environmental burdens, compared to current birds. This unique analytic approach provides biologically sound guidelines for strategic planning of sustainable broiler production.",1,train,131

210839419,"Diffusion auction is a new model in auction design. It can incentivize the buyers who have already joined in the auction to further diffuse the sale information to others via social relations, whereby both the seller's revenue and the social welfare can be improved. Diffusion auctions are essentially non-typical multidimensional mechanism design problems and agents' social relations are complicatedly involved with their bids. In such auctions, incentive-compatibility (IC) means it is best for every agent to honestly report her valuation and fully diffuse the sale information to all her neighbors. Existing work identified some specific mechanisms for diffusion auctions, while a general theory characterizing all incentive-compatible diffusion auctions is still missing. In this work, we identify a sufficient and necessary condition for all dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) diffusion auctions. We formulate the monotonic allocation policies in such multidimensional problems and show that any monotonic allocation policy can be implemented in a DSIC diffusion auction mechanism. Moreover, given any monotonic allocation policy, we obtain the optimal payment policy to maximize the seller's revenue.",0,train,171

The data revealed that the public is, in fact, willing to accept the use of personal information to achieve certain governmental objectives; however, not without limitation. Factors that affected the level of acceptance were the achievability of the policy, sensitivity of data being used, the specific governmental objective, and trust in the branch of government utilizing the data.

The remaining two empirical papers follow these recommendations in examining different facets of intermediary-mediated, community-based open innovation. Drawing on the Community of Practice perspective of knowledge, the second paper draws ideas from organizational behavior to examine the role of open innovation intermediaries in facilitating knowledge collaboration between client organizations and online communities. The third paper makes an additional contribution by integrating the Service-Dominant logic of marketing, to investigate what capabilities intermediaries deploy to enable clients to implement open service innovation through community-based crowdsourcing. By drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives that are under-explored within the literature, this thesis connects open innovation with external research domains, laying the foundation to advance the field toward a sturdier theoretical bent.

Here we report exome-sequencing analyses of 20,791 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 24,440 non-diabetic control participants from 5 ancestries. We identify gene-level associations of rare variants (with minor allele frequencies of less than 0.5%) in 4 genes at exome-wide significance, including a series of more than 30 SLC30A8 alleles that conveys protection against T2D, and in 12 gene sets, including those corresponding to T2D drug targets (P = 6.1 × 10−3) and candidate genes from knockout mice (P = 5.2 × 10−3). Within our study, the strongest T2D gene-level signals for rare variants explain at most 25% of the heritability of the strongest common single-variant signals, and the gene-level effect sizes of the rare variants that we observed in established T2D drug targets will require 75,000–185,000 sequenced cases to achieve exome-wide significance. We propose a method to interpret these modest rare-variant associations and to incorporate these associations into future target or gene prioritization efforts.Exome-sequencing analyses of a large cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes and control individuals without diabetes from five ancestries are used to identify gene-level associations of rare variants that are associated with type 2 diabetes.",1,train,206

Previous research show that brain areas including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and others involved in smoking addiction [1]. However it remains unclear which brain regions play a crucial role in smoking addiction and the relationship among these regions. Since functional connectivity does not support inferences about causal brain connections, the changes in information flow in these distributed systems involved in smoking remain largely unknown. Here we apply a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) in resting state fMRI [2] to demonstrate the causal relationships among the core regions in smoking addiction. ::: ::: Healthy college students were recruited through campus advertisements. Among those who responded, there were 14 cigarette smokers and 14 nonsmokers. All data were collected using a 3-Telsa Siemens Skyra scanner. Functional data were processed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI, which is based on SPM (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit. Based on literature, we specified four regions of interest (ROIs) within the default mode network (DMN), which are medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and bilateral inferior parietal lobule ( Left IPL and Right IPL), same regions and coordinates as in previous studies that use sDCM analysis for resting state [2,3]. Based on SPM12, we estimated and specified the DCM for each subject and later compared the differences of effective connectivity between two groups by using two-sample test. Our results suggest the different causal relationships between nonsmokers and smokers.

155365411,"Since climate change threatens human well-being across the globe and into the future, we require a concept of well-being that encompasses an equivalent ambit. This article argues that only a concept of human need can do the work required. It compares need theory with three alternative approaches. Preference satisfaction theory is criticised on the grounds of subjectivity, epistemic irrationality, endogenous and adaptive preferences, the limitlessness of wants, the absence of moral evaluation and the non-specificity of future preferences. The happiness approach is found equally wanting. The main section shows how these deficiencies can be addressed by a coherent theory of need. Human needs are necessary pre-conditions to avoid serious harm and are universalisable, objective, empirically grounded, non-substitutable and satiable. They are broader than ‘material’ needs since a need for personal autonomy figures in all theoretical accounts. Whilst needs are universal, need satisfiers are most often contextual and relative to institutions and cultures. The satiability and non-substitutability of needs is critical for understanding sustainability. Finally, it is argued that human needs provide an indispensable foundation for many current ethical arguments for global and inter-generational justice in the face of threats from climate change.

168793541,"The study attempts to define the dependence between how efficient insolvency proceedings are in particular countries (especially from the perspective of the yields for creditors from these proceedings) and the general level of development of the surveyed countries. This level of development is measured by the data of gross domestic product per inhabitant. The afore-mentioned data was selected on the basis of a hypothesis according to which the GDP per inhabitant in particular captures the ability of a given economic system to create wealth, whilst one of the fundamental prerequisites for such an ability is the general level of enforceability of a contract and therefore also the enforceability of a receivable. Insolvency proceedings as a formally demanding process based on legal specialties (usually an insolvency act) are a suitable representative of the requirement of enforceability of law. The yield for the creditor, then, is understood to be a crucial parameter of the insolvency system, for it is a natural gauge of the result of the enforcement process. Five groups of countries were formed for the purposes of comparison - the most developed European states, post-communist European states already included into the European Union, post-communist European states outside the EU, the most developed economies outside Europe and finally also oil-producing Arab states, where wealth is not necessarily proportional to the quality of enforceability of law. With the aid of regression analysis of the data, the work has proved that the quality of the legal environment measured by the efficiency of insolvency processes is truly related to the general efficiency of the economy. It is thus possible to assert on this foundation that, if we exclude states with exceptional mineral wealth, a high level of enforceability of law too is truly imperative in order to acquire wealth.",0,train,295

155225818,"Experts from both sides of the political spectrum in the United States agree that the healthcare system is in trouble. Overall, the U.S. healthcare system costs more and achieves less, per capita, than systems in other OECD nations. Opinions vary strongly, however, on the best solution to the problem. Some argue that public provision would be best able to provide universal coverage with lower prices. Others argue that only the market could ensure efficiency. The healthcare debate in the U.S. is further complicated by lobbying activity to protect existing interests. Health insurance companies argue strongly against any form of public provision, claiming such arrangements would make them unable to compete. Doctors’ organizations, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals also maneuver to ensure that any new legislation would not hurt them. Rather than build a full-scale merit comparison between the American and other industrialized countries’ approaches to healthcare, we simply argue that the U.S. adherence to private insurance does not address the goal of efficiency either with regard to the objective of the simply understood ""economic"" cost-benefit calculation, or in terms of maintaining some normatively set level of accessible care at the lowest cost. The U.S. at present defines its goals insofar as healthcare is concerned not normatively, but via the on-going political process. Currently, the central focus in this process is on cost controls rather than the extent to which politically set standards for care are met. Attempts to create legislation in the U.S. that balances political demands with efficiency are daunting and in practice generally result in sacrificing some of the goals to satisfy pressure groups.

154287658,"Instances of acute and sustained inflation pose a challenge in transition and developing economies, in particular as they tend to render economic development strategies vulnerable. Thus, a thorough understanding of inflationary episodes is critical. Using parametric hazard models, this examines the question of duration dependence of international inflationary episodes (IE) and also the influence of key covariates on the likelihood of their survival. From a sample of eleven historical high inflation episodes, fifteen recent hyperinflation cases, and forty-five international IE, the statistical evidence overall illustrates a case of positive duration dependence, indicating that IE are more likely to terminate as they grow older, and vice versa. The study's findings also suggest that variations in covariates including cumulative inflation geometric (annual) rate of inflation, and maximum (annual) inflation tend to have varying and statistically significant influence on the behavior of international IE durations. While not supporting the theoretical notion of an everincreasing inflation rate or inflation bubble, the finding of positive duration dependence in IE is not a justification for a ""laissez-faire"" policy by central banks. In fact, significant redistribution of wealth and increased inefficiency will result from IE, and thus credible monetary and fiscal reforms are fundamental for achieving economic stabilization and sustainable growth.",1,train,204

Methods: Bilateral US in the 3rd and 5th lumbar vertebrae of 64 volunteers carried out and the distance between skin to TP and skin to AP was measured. These distances were compared on both sides and in different BMI groups. The analysis was done using SPSS 11. Analysis of variance was used to compare the means at three vertebral levels (L3−L5) and different BMI groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Average weight was correlated with muscular endurance and cardiorespiratory endurance, and below average weight was correlated with flexibility and muscular endurance. On the other hand, in the case of male freshmen, the analysis revealed that obesity and average weight were significantly correlated with muscular endurance (LGRA=1 and 1, respectively), and below average weight was significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular endurance and power (LGRA=1, 0.91734872, and 0.838105731, respectively).The results could mean that different body composition of students have different strengths of fitness components. This combining psychology could specify a feasible strategy on remedial program of fitness.",1,train,220
128697373,This article examines the factors influencing manufacturing firms’ water reuse decision and analyses whether the structure of intake water demand differs between firms that adopt water reuse practices and those which do not. The first stage of the estimation model involves a Probit analysis of the water reuse decision and the second stage employs an endogenous switching regression to estimate the intake water demand equations. Results suggest that water charges may act as an effective mechanism in inducing firms to undertake water reuse investments and in reducing intake water demand. Estimates of the water demand price elasticities indicate that plants that reuse water are more sensitive to water price increases than plants without access to reuse technologies.,1,train,117
166821316,"""Contracting out placement services aims at enhancing the effectiveness of placements of unemployed job-seekers through market mechanisms. This paper analyses the effectiveness of the temporary assignment of needy job-seekers to private placement services by comparing their outcomes with respect to employment, unemployment and benefit receipt with those of a suitable control group. Using recently available administrative data we apply propensity score matching to construct the control group. We regard a period after a policy reform in 2005 that introduced a new means-tested benefit, the unemployment benefit II, and emphasized the activation of needy unemployed people. Hard-to-place job-seekers usually need more effort to be placed into a job. Therefore it is an interesting question whether groups of people with different a priori employment probabilities benefit to a different extent from an assignment to a private placement service. To answer this question we analyse several subgroups separated by sex, age, migration background, occupational education and time since the last job. Our results suggest that in some cases the assignment to private providers is relatively more effective for groups of job-seekers who are rather hard to place. Despite positive employment effects for some subgroups, however our results imply that the assignment to private providers is generally ineffective and in some subgroups counterproductive regarding the goal of avoiding unemployment and benefit receipt.""

14251051,"This study tests the hypothesis of linguistic relativity along two lines of research: a) how L2 learners of Chinese and English, respectively, syntactically package semantic components for caused motion (cause, manner, path) in an experimental situation in which they are asked to describe video clips showing caused motion events to an imagery addressee, and b) how monolingual native speakers of Chinese and English judge the similarity between caused motion scenes while viewing them. Our results regarding a) show that Chinese learners of English acclimate to the target pattern of organizing particularly dense caused motion information very rapidly, and English learners of Chinese also arrived at an inter–language showing considerable resemblance to the target system rather than traces of the L1 influence. Our findings regarding b) reveal that despite striking differences between Chinese and English in L1 motion descriptions, native speakers show an identical tendency to prefer the path–match alternate over the manner– match alternate. Overall, these observations suggest that language–specific constraints can be largely shaken off when encoding caused motion in a non– native language, and linguistic and non-linguistic representations of caused motion may be dissociable from each other.",1,train,189

16399062,"Resource subsidies are well known to increase population densities of consumers. The decomposition process of these subsidised resources can be influenced by increasing consumer abundance. However, few studies have assessed whether resource subsidies can promote resource decomposition via a population increase in consumers. Here, we examined the effects of keratin subsidies on feather decomposition in egret and heron breeding colonies. Egrets and herons (Ardeidae) frequently breed in inland forests and provide large amounts of keratin materials to the forest floor in the form of feathers of chicks (that die). We compared the decrease in the weights of egret and heron feathers (experimentally placed on the forest floor) over a 12-month period among egret/heron breeding colonies (five sites) and areas outside of colonies (five sites) in central Japan. Of the feathers placed experimentally on forest floors, 92-97 % and 99-100 % in colonies and 47-50 % and 71-90 % in non-colony areas were decomposed after 4 and 12 months, respectively. Then, decomposition rates of feathers were faster in colonies than in areas outside of colonies, suggesting that keratin subsidies can promote feather decomposition in colonies. Field observations and laboratory experiments indicated that keratin-feeding arthropods and keratinophilic fungi played important roles in feather decomposition. Therefore, scavenging arthropods and keratinophilic fungi, which dramatically increased in egret and heron breeding colonies, could accelerate the decomposition of feathers supplied to the forest floor of colonies.",1,train,230
55672255,"This article reports on the behaviour of Russian medium-size companies during the first months of economic recession. Using a convenient sample survey and a series of corporate stories we examine the options for turnaround strategies and the patterns of strategic choice. We find that economic recession provoked the 'return' of company owners to the role of 'internal strategists' or even into operations management. Under such conditions companies with dispersed ownership have visible disadvantages in building a consistent strategic agenda and timely implementation of robust strategies, as any strategic actions largely depend on a 'concert' of corporate strategists. Factor analysis of the actions implemented or planned for implementation reveals two patterns of strategic behaviour - cost leadership and differentiation. Cost leadership is the more popular option as it provides more chances for sustainability in the short term. The selection between the two strategic options is less determined by the company's past performance and competitiveness than by ambitions of key 'internal strategists'.",1,train,160
35649278,"Protons act as neuromodulators and produce significant effects on synaptic transmission. The molecular basis of neuromodulation by extracellular protons is partially explained by their effects on certain neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a family of eight receptor subtypes that are widely expressed throughout the mammalian CNS. In this study, the effects of physiologically relevant changes in extracellular pH were examined in mammalian cells expressing the mGluR subtypes: human mGluR1a, mGluR4a, mGluR5d or mGluR8b. The signal transduction coupling properties of mGluR4a and mGluR8b were switched from the adenylate cyclase (G(i)) pathway to the phospholipase C (G(q)) pathway by coexpression of a promiscuous G protein. Fluorometric imaging plate reader was used to measure changes in cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in response to agonist. Extracellular acidification from pH 8.0 to pH 6.5 progressively diminished mGluR4 responsiveness to the agonists L-glutamate and (2S,1'S,2'R)-2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine (L-CCG-I), and this inhibition was characterized by insurmountable antagonism. By comparison, extracellular acidification did not significantly alter mGluR8 responses to agonists. Furthermore, agonist activation of mGluR1a and mGluR5d was virtually unaffected by changes in pH. Because mGluR4 is expressed presynaptically and its activation inhibits the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA, we propose that the net effect of proton inhibition of mGluR4 would be to reverse or prevent that suppression of neurotransmitter release. As such, local decreases in pH could have significant effects on the regulation of transmitter release and synaptic tone via modulation of mGluR4.",1,train,242
86866524,"Sweden and Norway are two relatively similar countries in many respects. At a superficial glance, this is true also for the regional policy area. At a closer look, however, there are significant differences and consequently different experiences. An important part of the analysis focuses on how regional policies in Sweden as a member of the EU, and Norway as a non-member, are influenced by European integration. Our main hypothesis is that both countries' regional policy aims and measures move towards the EU's, Sweden's faster than Norway's. The current situation seems to be that Sweden increasingly put its trust into the Structural Fund programmes, while national regional policy is allowed to gradually wither away. To Norway as a non-member of the EU this is not an option, regional policy will have to be carried out within the state framework. While the EU dimension is important for understanding differences in recent tendencies, it should not be taken for granted as the decisive factor in explaining differences. This paper tries to illuminate the regional policy experience, to what extent regional policy has a good or bad image in the two countries, as an alternative explanation to the EU dimension. The argument is that the regional policy experience has been more positive in Norway than in Sweden and that current development must be understood in this light.",1,train,223

This DEP system consists of mercury as a movable liquid electrode, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, SU-8-based microchannels for electrode passages, and a PDMS medium chamber. A simple squeezing method was introduced to build a thin PDMS layer at the bottom of the medium chamber to create a contactless DEP system. To determine the operating conditions, the DEP force and the friction force were analytically compared for a single cell. In addition, an appropriate frequency range for effective DEP manipulation was chosen based on an estimation of the Clausius–Mossotti factor and the effective complex permittivity of the yeast cell using the concentric shell model. With this system, we demonstrated the active manipulation of yeast cells, and measured the collection efficiency and the dielectrophoretic velocity of cells for different AC electric field strengths and applied frequencies.

Participants were subliminally exposed to a novel female photograph. Then, implicit and explicit attitudes toward an exposed and an unexposed photograph were measured. This basic design was crossed with a cognitive load manipulation, which should deplete the capacity of self-control resources (low cognitive load vs. high cognitive load). Results showed that the subliminal mere exposure effect occurred for not only implicit attitudes but also explicit attitudes when participants’ cognitive resources were depleted in the high cognitive load condition. In contrast, when cognitive resources were not depleted, the subliminal mere exposure effect only emerged for implicit attitudes.

Experience in developed countries has shown that they reduce the incidence of invasive and non-invasive disease.

We conducted a systematic review to determine the distribution of serotype 19A, burden of pneumococcal disease and antibiotic resistance in the region. We performed a systematic review of serotype 19A data from observational and randomized clinical studies in the region, conducted between 1990 and 2010, for children under 6 years. Pooled prevalence estimates from surveillance activities with confidence intervals were calculated. We included 100 studies in 22 countries and extracted data from 63. These data reported 19733 serotyped invasive pneumococcal isolates, 3.8% of which were serotype 19A. Serotype 19A isolates were responsible for 2.4% acute otitis media episodes, and accounted for 4.1% and 4.4% of 4,380 nasopharyngeal isolates from healthy children and in hospital-based/sick children, respectively.

167448192,"Risk management is critical for a credit card company to survive in such competing industry. In addition to operational expenses, provisional loss is a major driver to a company’s expense. The provisional loss arises due to the “bad” accounts booked – bank lends the money to customers who eventually do not have capability to pay back. In the risk management, there are generally two stages a company can take to manage and control credit risks. The first stage occurs when booking a customer. An aggressive underwriting strategy could book and approve high risk population who seeks for credit card; while a conservative policy may only focus on upmarket and affluent population. As expected, the first strategy could generate both high revenues (interests charged) and high expenses due to bad accounts booked, resulting in trivial incremental net income; and the second strategy could generate not only low revenues but also low losses, resulting in incremental net income be trivial as well. There is always trade-off for different strategies in terms revenue generation and loss control. Finding an optimal strategy is often difficult and needs to be adjusted accordingly due to internal or external factors such as macroeconomic change, for example, almost all credit companies suppressed their approval rates for high risk segments of population and incurred huge financial loss during 2008/2009 economic depression. The second stage happens in customer management after the customer is booked. Although booked customers pass the first screen of risk control, the chance of false negative (false “good” accounts) could still be high. However, in the second stage, by leveraging their performance such as credit card utilization, payment information, risks can further be managed to control provisional loss. In our project, we will focus on the second stage of risk management, and particularly are interested in classifying if a booked account will be a “bad” account within 12 months since booked.

Research shows Alpha waves are predominantly observed in healthy relaxed individuals. Since anxiety and stress are major emotional contents of human beings, the goal of this experiment is to assess the means of relaxation and concentration using Alpha music, which influence the alpha and beta rhythms significantly. For each subject, three EEG recordings were taken. One before the alpha music stimulus, one after 6 minutes of Alpha music and the last towards the end of alpha music. There was an increase in the maximum amplitudes of Alpha waves either after 6 minutes or after 12 minutes of alpha music. However, the maximum amplitude of beta waves showed a decline of up to 40% from the initial value. The standard deviation of both Alpha and Beta waves are almost stable between the mid and final recording. These results, namely, the increase in Alpha activity and decrease in Beta activity indicate that subjects experience ‘relaxed alertness’. Under the influence of Alpha music, subjects reported a dramatic reduction in feelings of stress and an increased sense of physical relaxation compared to normal state.",1,train,243

It is aiming at science & technology, industry, human, social system as the four innovation areas for the implementation of innovation growth. In order to strategically innovate in these four areas, it was selected as the eight core business of R&D that smart hyper-connection/intelligence, smart factory, smart farm, fin-tech, energy-driven new industry, smart city, drones and autonomous driving cars. These eight core business area will be shifted from simple technology development projects to packagebased support systems that fully integrate technology, data, infrastructure, spillover, and improvement of social system. The Korean government has adopted the package support method and established the 4th Science and Technology Basic Plan in 2018 to reform the government’s R&D investment system. In order to manage packaged R&D investment, the Ministry of Science and ICT in Korea has commissioned KISTI (Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information) to develop the R&D PIE system, which is an integrated investment platform for technology-industry-social systems and now in pushing ahead upgrading. The PIE system is a national R&D platform that can be integrated with KISTI’s existing national R&D information in Korea, domestic and foreign patents, papers database, and domestic industrial information database.

Through descriptive analyses and a random parameters panel effects regression model, we analyze changes in the time spent on shopping between two consecutive waves of the panel differentiating between employment status transitions, after controlling for a set of socio-demographic variables and day of the week. Results indicate that while activity-travel patterns in general and shopping duration in particular are relatively stable for the groups showing no transitions in employment status, the transition groups show evidence of a reorganization of their shopping activities across the week. In addition, results of the model indicate that the relationship between change in employment status and dynamics in shopping behavior is not symmetrical.",1,train,159

Agents engage in one of two alternative occupations: either self-employment in an intermediate goods sector characterized by monopolistic competition, or employment as an ordinary worker in this sector. Entrepreneurial profits are stochastic. The occupational choice under risk endogenizes the number of firms in the intermediate goods industry. While the presence of entrepreneurial risk results in a suboptimally low number of firms and depresses growth, non-linear tax schemes are partly capable of compensating the negative by effects by ex post providing a social insurance.",1,train,107
201323647,"Abstract. This paper illustrates the relationship between energy reforms and economic sustainable development in Egypt and Iran; through analyzing the relation between energy reform and four main macroeconomic variables, namely: budget deficit, energy consumption, inflation and economic growth. The methodology adopted in this paper is a comparative case study between Egypt and Iran, using qualitative descriptive analysis; focusing on the period from 2010 to 2014, as this period is characterized with active subsidy reform efforts for both countries. The paper concludes that reforming energy subsidies generally tends to relief the strain on the public budget, in case it is not accompanied with simultaneous economic difficulties which can deem the reform efforts obsolete, like in the case of Iran. In addition, the responsiveness of energy consumption of a certain fuel to the increase in its price is heavily reliant on its price elasticity of demand. This is represented in the availability of alternative energy sources. Moreover, the effect of the reforms on inflation is normally instantaneous and short-lived and could be mitigated through government intervention; that was clear in the case of Egypt. However, Iran did not show a similar trend as there was a weak correlation between subsidy reforms and inflation. Finally, there tends to be a very weak relationship between subsidy reforms and GDP growth, implying that the effect of other economic factors outweighs that of subsidy reforms. Keywords.

146452954,"This article aims to extract from the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a basic theory of legal effects of unilateral instruments of international organizations in public international law. These effects can be divided into three categories. The first is substantive effects. These include binding, authorizing and (dis)empowering effects. The second category is causative effects, which are the triggering effects that determinations of fact or of law have on substantive effects by bringing them into existence. The third category is modal effects – how and when the substantive effects come into existence (e.g. immediate or deferred, retroactive or non-retroactive, reversible or irreversible effect). Each of these categories of legal effects behaves differently according to whether the effects are intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic effects are based on the special treaty powers of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly. In this hypothesis, all three categories of effects exist to the full extent that the explicit and implicit powers of the adopting body allow for them. Extrinsic effects are directly based on general international law, in particular on the rules of formation of customary international law. Here, there are no causative effects. Substantive effects do not strictly speaking exist; only pre-substantive ones do. And modal effects are always immediate, non-retroactive.",0,train,210

To facilitate direct observations of Cdc42 activation in live cells, we developed and validated a new biosensor of Cdc42 activation. The biosensor is genetically encoded, of single-chain design and capable of correctly localizing to membrane compartments as well as interacting with its upstream regulators including the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. We characterized this new biosensor in motile mouse embryonic fibroblasts and observed robust activation dynamics at leading edge protrusions, similar to those previously observed for endogenous Cdc42 using the organic dye-based biosensor system. We then extended our validations and observations of Cdc42 activity to macrophages, and show that this new biosensor is able to detect differential activation patterns during phagocytosis and cytokine stimulation. Furthermore, we observe for the first time, a highly transient and localized activation of Cdc42 during podosome formation in macrophages, which was previously hypothesized but never directly visualized.",1,train,161

For instance, we knew that we needed to make certain accommodations but were very aware, as was the student, of the necessity of not overaccommodating. Despite the fact that the physical therapy profession trains practitioners to help clients with disabilities to maximize their physical function and teaches them how to adapt to the challenges of daily activity, we initially assumed that a blind student would not be able to complete the program or be able to become a self-sufficient practitioner. We were very wrong.

It was found that down regulation of APAF1, a putative tumor suppressor gene (TSG), leads to resistance to chemotherapy and disease development in some cancers. In this study, we investigated the relation of APAF1 methylation status with its expression and clinicopathological factors in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Materials andMethods: Methylation Sensitive-High Resolution Melting Curve Analysis (MS-HRM) was employed in studying the methylation of CpG islands in the APAF1promoter region in MDS. Gene expression was analyzed by using real time RT-PCR. Results: 42.6% of patient samples were methylated in promoter region of APAF1analyzed, while methylation of the gene was not seen in controls (P<0.05). Methylation of APAF1was significantly associated with the suppression of its mRNA expression (P=0.00). The methylation status of APAF1in advanced-stage MDS patients (80%) was significantly higher than that of the early-stage MDS patients (28.2%) (P=0.001). The difference in frequency of hypermethylatedAPAF1 gene was significant between good (37.5%) and poor (85.71%) cytogenetic risk groups (P=0.043). In addition, a higher frequency of APAF1hypermethylation was observed in higher-risk MDS group (69.2%) compared to lower-risk MDS group (34.14%) (P=0.026).

3746820,"The increased concern about environmental problems caused by inadequate waste management, as well as the concern about global warming, promotes actions toward a sustainable management of the organic fraction of the waste. Landfills, the most common means to dispose of municipal solid waste (MSW), lead to the conversion of the organic waste to biogas, containing about 50% methane, a very active greenhouse gas (GHG). One unit of methane has a global warming potential of 21 computed for a 100-year horizon or 56 computed for 20 years. The waste sector in Israel contributes 13% of total greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions for a time horizon of 100 years (for a time horizon of 20 years, the waste sector contribution equals to more than 25% of total GHG emissions). The ultimate goal is to minimize the amount of methane (CH4) by converting it to CO2. This can be achieved by physicochemical means (e.g., landfill gas flare, incineration) or by biological processes (e.g., composting, anaerobic digestion). Since the waste in Israel has a high organic material content, it was found that the most cost-effective means to treat the degradable organic components is by aerobic composting (investment of less than US$ 10 to reduce emission of one ton CO2 equivalent per year). Another benefit of this technology is the ability to implement it within a short period. The suggested approach, which should be implemented especially in developing countries, could reduce a significant amount of GHG at relatively low cost and short time. The development of a national policy for proper waste treatment can be a significant means to abate GHG emissions in the short term, enabling a gain in time to develop other means for the long run. In addition, the use of CO2 quotas will credit the waste sector and will promote profitable proper waste management.",1,train,302

However, China initially implemented an unbalanced development strategy, which has resulted in a large number of labor force in the eastern coastal areas of the country that in turn helped the economic development of these regions. In the future, China plans on transferring its economic center to the midwest and northeast regions, which will also require a workforce. Thus, understanding the demographic situation is a must, especially the family planning policy's contribution to population loss in these provinces. This paper uses the propensity score matching method based on GDP per capita to calculate the absolute value of population loss in China's provinces due to the family planning policy by comparing these provinces with countries that do not implement the family planning policy using a 1:4 ratio. Additionally, we calculate the population loss ratio.

Student standards for health education were published in 1995 in the National Health Education Standards (Joint Committee on National Health Education Standards, 1995). These seven standards provide performance-based criteria required for meeting specific levels of health education knowledge and skills in elementary, middle-level, and secondary grades.

The article draws on a range of newspaper headlines that show something of the current contradictory responses to the changing role of the state, as well as the affective dimensions of those responses. Many of these headlines point to continuing attachments to collectivity and solidarity in insecure times – 'residual attachments', marked by the continuation of questions that cannot be answered in the terms of the dominant market ideology. But they also express newer identifications and politics, and these point to the need for state to also adapt to emergent, more dialogic, forms of engagement.",0,train,154

157099770,"Australian house prices have experienced significant growth over the past 10 years and on a number of measures the market appears overvalued. This paper outlines and assesses the arguments used to justify current prices. Rather than structural factors (such as population growth and housing supply) being the main elements supporting current house prices, the alternative view is that cyclical factors, essentially low interest rates and low unemployment, are the key factors currently keeping Australian house prices at their present levels. Analysis of the housing market from an investor's perspective also suggests that very optimistic assumptions of future house price growth and/or future rental growth are being factored into current market pricing. The strong economic conditions in Australia, reflected in the low unemployment rate, should protect the Australian housing market from a US-style housing collapse in the short term, but in the longer term increasing unemployment will inevitably cause some correction in house prices.",1,train,153

The ambition of this chapter is to explore if and how Western societies can mentally arm themselves against such threats and whether the concept of resilience can play a role in this. Two options present themselves. The isolationist option aims at closing off society from outward threats and maintaining the status quo. The other option sees resilience as renewal. This one lends itself as a useful interpretative framework to further study of the resilience of the home front as a contribution to deterrence.

145758567,"Abstract This article presents a new reading of Rifāʿa Rāfiʿ al-Ṭahṭāwī's Takhlīṣ al-ibrīz fī talkhīṣ Bārīz, using ‘sciences’ (al-ʿulūm) as a departure point through which to investigate how his seminal text works. The body of the article is comprised of five sections. Following a brief introduction I begin by examining al-Ṭahṭāwī's justifications for the mission's pursuit of sciences in Paris. These work to communicate a compatibility between Islamic precedent and learning sciences abroad. The next section moves to consider whether and how the ‘Franks’ sciences’ connect to their Christianity. I then focus on how al-Ṭahṭāwī categorically portrays those sciences the mission seeks to learn, which he refers to as ʿulūm ḥikmiyya, before turning to concentrate on his presentation of the universal structure of transmitted (naqliyya) and rational (ʿaqliyya) sciences. Together, these two sections show how al-Ṭahṭāwī incorporates and assimilates the Franks' sciences into an Islamic model, restricting these sciences as partial while easing and advocating for their integration into the Islamic lands. The fifth and final section looks more closely at how al-Ṭahṭāwī describes the universal sciences of language alongside the singularity of Arabic in order to draw attention to consequences of al-Ṭahṭāwī's efforts to translate across French and Arabic. In closing I offer a few remarks about how and why al-Ṭahṭāwī frames the Franks' sciences as he does, and suggest how the assimilation of their sciences impacts the greater Islamic structure that absorbs them.",0,train,235

Really, it is a story about students trying to seize kairos, the opportune moment in time to effectuate change. Seeing an opportune moment in time to call attention to a legal issue they identified as important, the three third-year law students in this story wrote, as amici curiae, a brief in support of a petition for certification to the New Jersey Supreme Court on the issue of whether indigent litigants in civil domestic violence cases have the right to court-appointed attorneys. These students and their professors believed the timing was right to argue that indigent litigants involved in the New Jersey domestic violence restraining order process have a legal right to court-appointed counsel as a requirement of equal access to a fair trial. The issue had been briefly raised several years earlier. However, the right to counsel issue had been completely disregarded by the courts, and no state-based advocacy groups pursued the issue. These students, in contrast, saw something to the issue that other advocates had missed. Moreover, they saw it at the right time in their own legal education to act on it, compellingly.

145584266,"Legal reforms over the past generation have transformed juvenile crime regulation from a system that viewed most youth crime as the product of immaturity into one that is ready to hold many youths to the standard of accountability imposed on adults. Supporters of these reforms argue that they are simply a response to the inability of the traditional juvenile court to deal adequately with violent youth crime, but the legal changes that have transformed the system have often been undertaken in an atmosphere of moral panic, with little deliberation about consequences and costs.In this book we argue that a developmental model of regulation that is grounded in scientific knowledge about adolescence and juvenile crime is more compatible with the justice system's commitment to fairness and also more likely to promote social welfare than the contemporary approach. This premise for the most part translates into a legal regime that deals with most adolescent offenders as an intermediate legal category of persons - neither children nor adults. Developmental knowledge clarifies that the typical teenage offender is less culpable than his adult counterpart and therefore deserves less punishment. It also indicates that most adolescents mature out of their inclination to get involved in criminal activity, and that correctional interventions may influence the trajectories of their adult lives. The research shows that programs that attend to developmental knowledge are likely to facilitate the transition to conventional adult roles, benefiting both young offenders and society by reducing recidivism and reducing the economic costs of crime regulation.",0,train,251

56237926,"Most investigations of the consequences of environmental policies and Pigouvian taxes (pollution charges,in particular carbon taxes) using CGE models reveal an only modest impact on economic activity; some report even positive economic side effects. Yet the slowdown in economic growth and in particular of productivity,see Conrad and Wastl (1995),suggest a stronger and negative influence in particular if one accounts for the fortunately very low energy prices that accompanied the ambitious goals of environmental policies in the late 1980s and the 1990s. This paper attempts to explain this apparent difference. In particular it will be shown that environmental policies,here investigated for pollution charges,call for a modification of incentives such that the power of optimal incentives is reduced to which workers will respond with less effort. This friction,which may add up to significant numbers for the economy at large,is neglected in both the theoretical literature and in the application of CGE-models.

19920037,"Abstract When a fish stock shifts from one nation to another nation, e.g., due to climate change, the nation that loses the resource has incentives to deplete it, while the other nation, receiving the resource, has incentives to conserve it. We propose an analytical model to study under which circumstances self-enforcing agreements can align incentives. Our setup allows to distinguish between a fast and a slow shift and between a smooth or a sudden shift in ownership. We show that the shorter the expected duration of the transition, the higher the total equilibrium exploitation rate. Similarly, a sudden shift implies—by and large—more aggressive non-cooperative exploitation than a gradual shift. However, a self-enforcing agreement without side-payments is more likely for a sudden than for a smooth shift. Further, the scope for cooperation increases with the expected duration of the transition, and it decreases with the renewability of the resource and the discount rate. Most importantly, we show that concentrating on in-kind transfers can be very detrimental for shifting renewable resources: In some cases, there is no efficient bargaining solution without side-payments, even when there are only two players.",0,train,187

The research points what is in term of controversial or sensitive issue still acceptable and what they do not want to allow to regulate similar topics. We find if the values and principles of creators can affect the final form of advertising or PR article that gets to the public. Research was conducted via online interviews. Via e-mail we sent out 9 questions about the attitude of creators to ethics, personal values and the use of Christian themes in advertising. The selection criteria were that the worker has to work directly on advertising content according to the clients brief and he or she has to have at least 3 years practice in this area.

152648717,"The establishment of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the predecessor of the European Central Bank, on 1 January 1994, was a milestone in the process of European monetary integration. In this paper, we look at the work on the international and European monetary system of Alexandre Lamfalussy, its first president. Lamfalussy pursued a threefold career: as a private banker, a central banker and an academic. Partly under the influence of Robert Triffin, Lamfalussy soon became interested in international monetary issues. This paper analyses his views on the international monetary system and on European monetary integration, including his contributions to the Delors Report, which provided the framework for European monetary union. The paper draws extensively on archival research in the Lamfalussy papers at the Bank for International Settlements and the minutes of the EEC Committee of Governors' meetings. The paper provides not only an analysis of Lamfalussy's thought on European monetary integration, but also offers crucial insight into the Weltanschauung and way of thinking of European central bankers in this period.",1,train,170

141424722,"This paper argues that in the wake of Crawford, Davis, and Bryant, trial courts are in need of a workable definition of “ongoing emergency,” as well as a test or set of guidelines that can be applied in assessing the admissibility of statements made under such circumstances. In essence, this paper seeks to answer two important questions now confronting trial courts: (1) what is an “ongoing emergency,” and (2) what set of factors can enable a trial court to establish the existence of an ongoing emergency? Ultimately, in defining “ongoing emergency,” this paper borrows from earlier Supreme Court rulings in the Fourth Amendment context. For purposes of the Confrontation Clause, this paper defines “ongoing emergency” the same way the Court has previously defined “exigent circumstances”: a situation in which “there is an imminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that evidence will be immediately destroyed” for the purpose of hindering future prosecution, “or that a suspect will escape.” This definition is relied upon in part because it is offered, in dissent, by Justice Ginsburg, a vocal critic of the Court’s apparent retreat from Crawford. It is also relied upon, in part, because it seems to stand up to most situations in which officers might obtain statements from a declarant not solely for the purpose of preserving testimony for future prosecution. This paper also prescribes a flexible totality of the circumstances test that courts can apply in ascertaining whether the facts surrounding a declarant’s statement(s) do, in fact, constitute an emergency. This test places great emphasis on whether the facts create a situation in which the declarant’s statement bears sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant admission.",0,train,277

56298727,"Leadership has been identified as one of the main factors affecting productivity in every work organisation. This paper examines leadership-productivity nexus using Nigeria as a focal point. This paper reviews critically the concepts of leadership and productivity. It examines the various theories of leadership as well as other empirical works on the subject matter. Further, it explores the various meanings of productivity, how it is measured, factors that affect it and some benefits associated with productivity improvement. In discussing leadership-productivity nexus, the paper argues that situations usually determine the leadership style that may be applied to motivate higher productivity among employees in work organisations. The paper posits that due to poor style of leadership, productivity of workers in both public and private sectors has remained dismal. However, this is not surprising considering the fact that work organisations are the microcosms of larger Nigeria society in which poor political leadership has deprived the nation from transforming from a poverty stricken country to a more prosperous and buoyant one. The paper, therefore, argues that unless there is effective and focused political and organisational leadership and virile followership both at the organisational and national levels, the vision of improved productivity in work organisations and national development will remain a mirage Keywords : Leadership, productivity, leaders, work organisation, national development.",1,train,216
29289333,"Ex-post opportunistic behavior, commonly present in bilateral trade relationships, is a key element of the transaction cost economics. Investment in outside options is a prime example of such opportunism and often leads to inefficiency, for example by exerting effort to search for alternative business partners even if it does not add trade value. We experimentally investigate a bilateral trade relationship in which standard theory assuming self-regarding preferences predicts that the seller will be better off by investing in the outside option to improve his bargaining position. The seller’s investment, however, might negatively affect the buyer’s other-regarding preferences if the investment is viewed as opportunistic. We find overall support for our hypotheses that arise from the link between other-regarding behavior and opportunism. Our findings suggest that when the transaction cost economics approach is applied to the design of a governance structure, other regarding preferences, if relevant, should be taken into account.",0,train,150

155938727,"Incoterms 2010 provide harmonized interpretation rules for eleven common trade terms. From these eleven common terms, a trader has to choose the Incoterm that is most appropriate for the specific transaction he wishes to engage in. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) encourages the use of ‘multimodal’ terms (FCA, CPT, CIP, etc.) instead of the ‘maritime’ Incoterms (FAS, FOB, CFR and CIF). According to the ICC, maritime terms are not appropriate, and thus should not be used in container trade, as the seller does not ‘deliver’ the container on board the vessel, but most often hands over the goods to the carrier at an inland point or terminal. This paper intends to examine the underlying rationale behind this advice. Furthermore, this paper intends to provide support for traders, proposing criteria that might be applied to choose the right Incoterm.

154292581,"What is left to say about authoritarian legacies, with so much scholarship already on the topic, and long after the demise of de facto rule in Latin America? As nations move farther and farther away from the era of authoritarianism, we might naturally assume that the influence of those regimes would dissipate as well. The books under review here arrive on our shelves two decades or more since many of the countries of the region recovered their democratic practices. It would be convenient to say that the mere passage of time has erased painful memories of the repression, rendered militaries less politically influential, and given democratic institutions time to congeal. It would also be wrong. It turns out that memories cannot be easily erased, even less so for the families of victims who have never recovered the bodies of their loved ones or have never had their day in court. Military institutions vary in influence but remain relevant, at times interventionist, and have to be dealt with. Progress toward institutional consolidation can be found, but many democracies are still struggling, and some are in serious trouble. For these reasons alone, these three books are timely and relevant. Still, it would be a mistake to attribute their relevance to the conventional notion that the past matters solely because democracies suffer under the weight of authoritarian carryovers.

In this paper these questions are examined through the analysis of a longitudinal case study (1994-2012) of telemedicine adoption in a northern Swedish county. The findings reveal that it is not sufficient to make an open voluntary technology available for its users, or passively demand them to use the technology. Successful use would occur through a continuous interplay between users’ technology mental models and their organisational setting and work practices. When in contradiction with the latter, users would not consider the system and hence its use could fade away. Institutional entrepreneurs who have the ability to imagine new and different possibilities and encourage organisational members to experiment and explore possible use and benefit from the technology could influence the initial mental model.",1,train,179

A comprehensive inductive reading of these documents reveals that legal and policy issues were often raised or confronted in the course of resolving technical problems. In many of these instances, the technical decisions that resulted had law-like effects in the sense that they constrained or enabled the ways in which users can communicate and can access and use information over the Internet, whether or not such decisions supported or subverted legal decision-making, and whether or not legal decision-makers understood the societal implications of the technical decisions that were being made. This is one of the two ways in which technical and legal decision-making have become interpenetrated. The literature on legal engagement with problems generated by the technical features of the Internet is vast.

55665739,"All over the world the retirement landscape is changing. Probably one of the bigger and more fundamental changes is the rise in the pension eligibility age. The fact that these reforms came quickly after the closing of early retirement opportunities urged the pre-pension cohorts to adjust their retirement outlooks. This research studied older workers’ emotional reactions to reforms that induce them to extend their working lives with a number of years. Using data from a large scale sample survey among 6,800 older workers in the Netherlands, aged 60–65 at time of interview in 2015, we examined why the pension reforms trigger stronger emotional reactions in some individuals than in others. We integrated theoretical insights from the theory of emotion and the resource-based perspective on retirement adjustment. Testing our hypotheses revealed that emotions are stronger among individuals that have less access to resources. Anger and worry is more prevalent among older workers in more demanding jobs, with less favorable personal (health, wealth) and social resources (no partner support). This research suggests that policy makers—mostly higher level professionals who are much less exposed to the challenges of working longer—have underestimated the psychological and social impact of the reforms on vulnerable groups of older workers and, in particular, less educated older workers with lower social status. With a further increase of retirement age to be expected, policy makers are challenged to design policies that spare vulnerable groups in particular, for example, by facilitating more flexibility in the retirement transition.",1,train,246
5895672,"The natural tendency for humans to choose with whom to form new relationships and with whom to end established relationships is thought to facilitate the emergence of cooperation. Helping cooperators to mix assortatively is believed to reinforce the rewards accruing to mutual cooperation while simultaneously excluding defectors. However, the relationship between endogenous partner selection, assortativity, and cooperation has been largely unexplored experimentally. Here we report on a series of human subjects experiments in which groups of 24 participants played a multi-player prisoner's dilemma game where, critically, they were also allowed to propose and delete links to players of their own choosing at some variable rate. Over a wide variety of parameter settings and initial conditions, we found that endogenous partner selection significantly increased the level of cooperation, the average payoffs to players, and the assortativity between cooperators. Even relatively slow update rates were sufficient to produce large effects resulting in cooperation levels over 80%. Subsequent increases to the update rate still had a positive, although smaller, effect. For standard prisoner's dilemma payoffs, we also found that assortativity resulted predominantly from cooperators avoiding defectors, not by severing ties with defecting partners, and that cooperation correspondingly suffered. Finally, by modifying the payoffs to satisfy two novel conditions, we found that cooperators did punish defectors by severing ties, leading to levels of cooperation approaching 100% which persisted for longer.",1,train,226

Undoubtedly; this to a large extent has emboldened the economic profile of the country, especially in the 1970’s when it was described as a boom. It was this high economic pedestal that propelled the country to become an important continental player even in the West African sub-region. More important is the emergence of a nouveaux riche whose claim to affluence is traceable to emphatic link with the oil and gas industry. Regrettably, the region where this wealth is derived is wallowing in ash-mouthed poverty. As the Sir Henry Willink Commission of 1958 declared, it is ‘backward, neglected and poor’. Majority of the people that inhabit the place are not only existing below the bread line level, but denied of lifesaving amenities. This paradox is an obvious reflection of official misgovernance, ‘confusion of Agendas’ and leadership dysfunctionalism.

The aftermath is the grim struggle for survival, erosion of ethical standards and Juvenal delinquency. With analytical method which include a review of relevant literature on the Niger Delta including official findings and statements, the paper discovered that there is a discernable nexus between the poverty in the region and lack of human security.

Literature review shows inadequate understanding of lagged effects, which raises methodological and theoretical issues with the current quantitative studies of democracy. Using country-years as a unit of analysis, the author estimates a series of OLS PCSE models for each predictor with a systematic analysis of the distributions of the lagged effects. The second set of multiple OLS PCSE regressions are estimated including all three independent variables. The results show that economic development, education, and gender have three unique trajectories of the time-delayed effects: Economic development has long-term effects, education produces continuous effects regardless of the timing, and gender equality has the most prominent immediate and short term effects.

While recent work has focused on how to model risk in Markov decision processes using risk measures, it has not addressed the problem of solving large risk-averse formulations. In this paper, we propose and analyze a new method for solving large risk-averse MDPs with hybrid continuous-discrete state spaces and continuous action spaces. The proposed method iteratively improves a bound on the value function using a linearity structure of the MDP. We demonstrate the utility and properties of the method on a portfolio optimization problem.",0,train,91

The study was conducted in conjunction with Lutheran Social Services of Minnesota, a religiously affiliated social services charity. The field experiment has three main treatments: a baseline with no subsidy, a rebate to donors of a portion of their contribution to the charity, and an equivalent matching contribution. Within each subsidy treatment there are two rates of subsidy: 20 and 25 percent rebates and 25 and 33 percent matches. We report results that for the most part validate prior laboratory experiments.

153823144,"In view of the continuum of human existence, it is apparent that we are always living in between the past and the future. Yet we intuitively and perpetually make arbitrary demarcations among the past, the present, and the future. Parallel to one’s memory of one’s lived early childhood experience, our collective memory of the past — especially the remote past — can be hazy, indefinite, and surrealistic. Just as one’s present state of mind shapes one’s understanding of one’s early childhood experiences, contemporaneous ideologies can circumscribe historical inquiries into the collective past. Thus, teaching about the past is always a value-laden inquiry. As Ann Chinnery is keenly aware of the interconnections between the aims and the methods of teaching about the past, she argues that teaching about the past must foster critical historical consciousness so learners may apprehend and appreciate difficult knowledge from the past. To Chinnery, cultivating critical historical consciousness differs from “a cognitive, knowledge-based approach” to recollecting the past. More specifically, Chinnery, in line with Emmanuel Levinas and Roger Simon, acknowledges and affirms that one’s “here and now subjectivity” has always been interwoven with the past at both individual and collective levels. Drawing from her teaching experience, Chinnery further concludes that cultivating critical historical consciousness need not rely upon personal testimony. Instead, teaching and learning about the past should focus on facilitating learners’ undertaking critical contextual inquiries into the formation of subjectivity and public policies. Such critical inquiries, while disquieting, can lead to recognizing our ethical responsibilities of “receiving the past” and “shaping the future.”",0,train,257

149859398,"In this manuscript, I build and expand on prior work by myself (Nowakowski, 2016) and others exploring the dynamics of embodiment among people with chronic health conditions. Specifically, I critically investigate the intersecting social and medical elements of responses to bodies perceived as too thin and otherwise lacking in physical ability, using my own experiences of living and aging with cystic fibrosis (CF) as a case example. In these explorations, I center gendered identity and its intersection with disabling physical illness. I do so by using my own lived experiences as autoethnographic anchor points to guide critical review of key concepts from the nexus of these two content areas. I focus throughout on exploring how others’ reactions to a frail-looking body often constitute a form of forced gendering via the narratives people attempt to construct for why a person’s body appears that way. The title of the manuscript supports this framework by referencing three cornerstones of patient experience in the CF community: the general trend of patients having salty skin due to the pathology of the disease, a prior embodiment project called Salty Girls (Pettigrew, 2012) that engages this idea, and the more abstract concept of “saltiness” in describing the grit marginalized people display in responding to microaggressions.",0,train,208

19015794,"With about 30% increase over three months, Facebook has become a major online venue among Arabic young generation. However the understanding of its adoption as well as the cultural influence remains in its infancy. In recent study, Srite and Karahanna (2006) examined the cultural impact at the individual level and, built upon Hofstede’s framework, conceptualize it as espoused national cultural values, which were proposed to moderating the effects of TAM variables, i.e., perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and subjective norms, on IT acceptance. Although insightful, the conceptualization of espoused national cultural values and its impacts requires further validation with subjects from different cultural backgrounds and IT artifacts which may be more subject to cultural influences, e.g., social networking sites. Therefore, this study is aimed to validate and extend the work by Srite and Karahanna (2006) by examining the role of espoused national cultural values in Facebook adoption among Arabic female college students. Considering the cultural differences, we extended the original cultural dimensions in (Srite and Karahanna 2006) to incorporate long-term orientation and also explicate the dimension of collectivism/individualism along two directions, e.g., horizontal vs. vertical. Different from the IT artifacts (PC and PDA) examined in (Srite & Karahanna, 2006), the IT artifact examined in this study is Facebook and its usage may be subject to more cultural influences than using PC and/or PDA, since Facebook involves a lot of social interaction and socialization. A survey study with 200 college female students in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of UAE was conducted to validate the research model. 127 students returned the valid responses. At the moment of data collection, all respondents were new users of Facebook. Data collection involved two stages. The first stage was to collect the response for TAM variables and espoused national cultural values; while the second one, after one week, was for Facebook adoption. Smart PLS was used for data analysis. We expect that the results not only provide further empirical validation of Srite & Karahanna’s theory (2006) with Arabic sample, but also extend the original research by demonstrating complete range of cultural dimensions. Currently, we are in the stage of finalizing data analysis results. By the time of the conference, we shall be able to provide the complete results.",1,train,374

Indeed, in most European Union (EU) countries, there has been broad consensus about integration between the main parties. Importantly, previous research shows that this elite convergence is not replicated among the voters. Using European Election Study (EES) data from the 1999 and 2004 Euroelections, this article analyses the ideological dispersion of parties on the EU dimension in the EU member states. We examine the development of inter-party competition on the EU dimension between the two elections, and then test the impact of various factors – divided into public opinion, national party system and EU hypotheses – on the breadth of party positions over integration. The strongest link exists between government size and ideological alternatives, with large coalition governments hindering party competition on the EU dimension.

It mines a rich vein of work sustained at Cambridge over many years. Contributors to this work have included Jean Rudduck, Michael Fielding, Donald McIntyre, John MacBeath and Madeleine Arnot. The modes of participation considered include student voice or consultation, students as researchers, participative pedagogy and student leadership. These resonate with the values of the Leadership for Learning (LfL) endeavour (MacBeath & Dempster, 2009) in which shared leadership is a cornerstone. This article explores the relationship between the key concepts of learning, participation and democracy. It draws its analysis from a series of key projects initiated under the umbrella of LfL in Cambridge in recent years, including the „Influence and Participation of Young People in their Learning‟ project (MacBeath et al., 2008), the „Evaluation of the Learning to Lead Initiative‟ project (Frost & MacBeath, 2010) and the „Student Leadership for School Improvement‟ project (Roberts & Nash, 2010).

In addition, many scholars have called for an examination of differences in public service motivation across levels of government, such as Pandey and Stazyk (2008).

115132320,"A consumption tax amounts to exempt savings from taxation. As such, it would have important distributional effects, first of all from the poor to the rich, but also towards capital intensive industries; and intergenerational, away from the very young (students) and the old. For what concerns long term effects, most studies show that a consumption tax would be moderately more efficient and much simpler than the income tax. Nevertheless with such a tax, the progressivity of the current system could not be replicated. Attempts to mitigate the regressive features of the consumption tax would unavoidably lower the efficiency gains, and significantly increase complexity. I conclude that the passage to a consumption tax has to be done on the basis of a judgement of value (how progressive should our tax system be?), and not based on technical arguments. Shifting to a consumption tax would also imply an extremely complex transition that could be characterised by unemployment and inflation. For monetary policy, monitoring the economy during this transition would be extremely complex. Given the mixed picture that emerges from the analysis, I conclude asking why the consumption tax has taken such an echo in the current debate. May be because it is supposed to serve objectives that are not explicitly stated: either the objective of increasing competitiveness (but then, other tools like the exchange rate seem more straightforward and efficient), or the objective of reducing public spending.",0,train,235

Natural Gas in Asia is a new edition of a 2002 study on the future of natural gas in the major energy markets of Asia. The 2nd edition has been substantially rewritten and completely updated, and contains two new chapters on South East Asia, Australia, and the Middle East. The future energy needs and environmental problems of China, India and the rest of Asia are considerable. A major question is whether gas supplies can and will respond to expanding demand for the cleanest fossil fuel? Large scale projects will need to be implemented in Russia, the Central Asian Republics and the Middle East to bring required supplies to Asian markets in the years to 2020. This book assesses the economic opportunities, political obstacles and other challenges - both domestic and international - to these projects. In order to succeed, pipeline infrastructure will need to be built over long distances to bring gas to these markets, as well as significant numbers of new LNG terminals. The volume discusses the major current and potential gas markets in Asia: China, India, Japan and Korea, as well as the potential supply of pipeline gas and LNG to Asia from: Russia, Central Asia, South East Asia, Australia and Middle Eastern countries. An important aspect of the next two decades will be the extent to which the region can develop pipeline gas sources to supplement existing large scale LNG imports. The volume also looks at the substantial gas markets emerging in China and India which are at the early stage of introducing large scale natural gas use in cities. These markets face the commercial challenge of developing gas-fired power generation at a cost which may be greater than generation based on domestically produced coal. However, considerations of local air quality and global emissions may give extra value to gas fired generation, as has happened elsewhere in the world.

Despite its diverse emphasis on materialist, idealist and institutionalist factors, the demographic approach can be criticized for neglecting the interdisciplinary challenge behind the phenomenon. Instead, these approaches operate on the basis of an “equation model of society” that essentially attempts gradually to enhance the illumination of the black box that “contains” the passage of young women to adulthood, leaving them with fewer children born at a later age. While acknowledging the contributions of this research, the article suggests considering the life-course perspective in its full potential as a starting point for an interdisciplinary triangulation of the issue.

The present study determined the association between serum NGAL and iron status in chronic kidney disease with anemia. A total of 154 adult CKD patients were divided into anemia and without anemia groups. The anemia groups were further subdivided into two groups based on the presence or absence of iron deficiency, defined as a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. The NGAL was measured for all the 154 patients, and the possible relationships with iron status were analyzed. 27.7% patients with TSAT < 20% presented lower hemoglobin, serum iron, serum ferritin, and higher NGAL values than those without iron deficiency. NGAL was inversely correlated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, serum iron, and TSAT. NGAL adequately diagnosed the status of iron deficiency among CKD patients by ROC analysis. The optimal NGAL cutoff value able to identify iron deficiency was found to be > 244.8 ng/mL, with 73.01% sensitivity and 68.29% specificity.

There is mixed ownership to the firm; a fraction is owned by foreigners whose welfare does not enter the home government’s objective function.

The familiar trade-off between efficiency and rent extraction will involve over-pollution, with (possibly) a subset of the most emission-intensive firm types being induced to relocate. This effect is reinforced by increased foreign ownership, as the cost of leaving rent then increases. (Ownership has no real impact under complete information.)

The system includes an interceptor for intercepting datastreams from a computer network intended for an application program; a scanner for scanning the intercepted datastream for trigger events, such as cookie data, script commands, and applet programs; and an event response generator for processing detected trigger events. Configuration data is used to identify a response for trigger events such as disabling script commands or programs and deleting or modifying cookie data. The event indicators and an action menu are generated by the event response generator and delivered with the processed datastream to the application program. The application program displays the event indicators so the user is made aware of the trigger events and the action menu allows a user to respond to the detected trigger events. In the preferred implementation, the user may respond by obtaining information about the site which transmitted the datastream having the trigger events and then send e-mail to the administrator of the site. Other actions include modifying the configuration data so subsequent datastreams with the trigger event is passed by the system. Outbound messages from the application program are also intercepted and scanned for trigger events. In the preferred implementation, the configuration data are exchanged between the system and the application program so the user may modify the operation of the system. The configuration data are deleted from the outbound datastream before it is transmitted in the preferred implementation.

154761699,"Spain's transport infrastructure policy has become a paradigmatic case of oversupply and of mismatch with demand. The massive expansion of the country's transport infrastructure over the last decade has not been a response to demand bottlenecks or previously identified needs. For this reason, the intensity of use today on all interurban modes of transport in Spain falls well below that of other EU countries. This paper analyzes the institutional and regulatory factors that have permitted this policy, allowing us to draw lessons from the Spanish case that should help other countries avoid the pitfalls and shortcomings of Spanish policy. Based on our analysis, we also discuss policy remedies and suggest reforms in different regulatory areas, which could help improve the performance of Spain's infrastructure policy.",1,train,125
33407849,"We examine trends since 1980 in material extraction in China, India, Indonesia, and Japan—which together contain over 40% of the world’s population—to assess the environmental consequences of modernization. Economic and population growth has driven rapid expansion of material extraction in China, India, and Indonesia since 1980. China and India exhibit patterns consistent with the Jevons paradox, where the economic intensity of extraction (extraction/GDP) has steadily declined while total extraction grew. In Indonesia, extraction intensity grew along with total extraction. In Japan, total extraction remained roughly constant, increasing somewhat in the 1980s and then slowly declining after 1990, while extraction intensity declined throughout the entire period. These different patterns can be understood to some degree by drawing on political-economic and world-systems perspectives. Japan is an affluent, core nation that can afford to import materials from other nations, thereby avoiding escalation of material extraction within its borders. China and India are rapidly industrializing nations that, although increasingly drawing on resources from beyond their borders, still rely on their own natural resources for growth. Indonesia, an extraction economy with less global power than the other nations examined here, exports its own natural resources, often unprocessed, to spur economic growth. The trends highlighted here suggest that in order to avert environmental crisis, alternative forms of development, which do not involve traditional economic growth, may need to be adopted by nations around the world.",1,train,229

151996728,"Previous discussions of the Frankfurt School’s work on Judeophobia have almost entirely neglected the Critical Theorists’ pathbreaking analysis of “secondary antisemitism” after Auschwitz. This new form of Jew-hatred originates in the political and psychological desire to split off, repress, and downplay the memory of the Holocaust because such memory, with which Jews are often identified, evokes unwelcome guilt feelings. As Holocaust memory undermines the uncritical identification with a collective, family, or nation tainted by anti-Jewish mass atrocities, the repression of national guilt may unconsciously motivate the reproduction of resentments that helped cause the Shoah. In this light, the article re-examines the empirical postwar German study Group Experiment and other works of the Frankfurt School. Three specific defensive mechanisms in relation to historical collective guilt feelings are identified that engender a variety of antisemitic projections—from “Jewish power” to “Jewish money” and other anti-Jewish tropes—after the Holocaust. It is argued that these insights into post-Holocaust secondary antisemitism, empirically analyzed in the German context, can partly be transferred to other contexts in European democracies and beyond. This article demonstrates that an unprocessed history of national guilt can have a negative impact on democracy and the resilience of antisemitism.",1,train,195

We estimate a vector autoregession to examine the joint behavior of returns, cash-flow news, and trading between individuals and institutions. Our main finding is that institutions buy shares from individuals in response to good cash-flow news, thus exploiting the underreaction phenomenon. Institutions are not simply following price momentum strategies: When price goes up in the absence of positive cash-flow news, institutions sell shares to individuals. Although institutions are trading in the 'right' direction, institutions as a group outperform individuals by only 1.44 percent per annum before transaction and other costs, because they are extremely conservative in deviating from the value-weight market index.",0,train,138

Red and white skeletal muscle fibers have very different antioxidant enzyme activities and resistance to oxidative stress. In this paper, we demonstrate that the activity of OGG1 is significantly higher in the red type of skeletal muscle compared with white fibers from old rats. Exercise training resulted in increased OGG1 activity in the nuclei of red fibers and decreased activity in nuclei of white fibers and in the mitochondria of both red and white fibers. The activities of UDG were similar in both red and white muscle fibers. Exercise training appears to increase the activity of UDG in the nuclei and mitochondria. However, exercise training affects the activity of OGG1 in nuclei and mitochondria differently, suggesting different regulation of the enzymes. In contrast, UDG showed similar activities in nuclei and mitochondrial extracts of exercise-trained animals. These data provide evidence for differential regulation of UDG and OGG1 in maintaining fidelity of DNA in oxidatively stressed cells.",1,train,192

Second, it aims at contributing to a more general methodological discussion about agent-based models by proposing an econometric analysis of the results of the simulations. The case of the pharmaceutical industry has been studied extensively by scholars because, despite the high level of R&D intensity, the industry has been characterized by a relatively low levels of concentration. The model is able to reproduce the main stylized facts of the industry in an evolutionary perspective. In this paper we extend the analysis conducted in two previous works (Garavaglia et al. 2012, 2013) by further qualifying the findings with an extensive econometric investigation of the model outputs. The paper focuses the attention on the determinants of market structure, the innovative performance of the industry, the diversification in multiple submarkets and the level of prices. We find that the properties of the technological and demand regimes are key determinants of the patterns of industry evolution and that the main mechanisms driving the model are the random processes of search, the discovery of new submarkets as well as the interactions between patent protection, imitation and price competition. In addition, this paper emphasizes how the emerging leaders in the industry are those innovative early entrants which entered in large submarkets, showing the importance of the first mover advantage and of the size of the “prize” accruing to innovators when they discover a new rich submarket.",1,train,253

However, the MTH process possesses a C 1 -entity reactant and cannot, therefore, shed any light on the homologation reaction sequence. The reaction and deactivation mechanism of the zeolite H-ZSM-5-catalyzed ETH process was elucidated using a combination of complementary solid-state NMR and operando UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, coupled with on-line mass spectrometry. This approach establishes the existence of a homologation reaction sequence through analysis of the pattern of the identified reactive and deactivated species.

This theoretical analysis offers another attempt to predict the implications of technological progress in the traded formal sectors on informal wage, taking into consideration that real wage is a reasonable benchmark to measure the well-being of the economically marginalised people living under informal arrangements. The key model propositions are further exemplified by a sensitivity analysis using plausible ranges of parameter values for India. We also provide empirical evidence using data on twenty-seven Indian States (including one Union Territory) between 1989 and 2010 on informal wages, capital stocks in informal and formal zones and value-additions in the formal segment to substantiate the model prediction on informal wage depicted in our numerical exercise, which shows that the growth in informal wage could reasonably be linked to the productivity surge in the formal sectors, while greater capital accumulation in the informal units over the formal counterparts has further aggravated this upswing in informal wages.",1,train,230

149215796,"This thematic issue of Media and Communication features articles that address the workings of democracy as understood through the lens of media history. The intersection of democracy and media history brings together two impossibly expansive terms, so expansive that the articles herein cannot provide any meaningful closure to the questions that even a cursory consideration of media history and democracy would provoke. Instead of closure, what these authors develop is a demonstration of the value of media history to our understandings of democracy. Historical methods of inquiry are necessary components for any meaningful understanding of media or democracy, and the authors gathered here work from a multi-hued palette of historiographical approaches. One finds in this issue a careful attention to how issues related to media history and democracy can be investigated through consideration of intellectual history, the history of political debates, journalism history, and the history of media organizations and institutions. These articles make a strong case for the continued relevance of media history to understanding the democracy and the media.",1,train,171
3421625,"OBJECTIVES ::: To investigate factors that predict speed of recovery and long-term CD4 cell count in HIV-1 seroconverters initiating combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and to quantify the influence of very early treatment initiation. We make use of all pre-treatment CD4 counts, because analyses using only a single observation at initiation may be subject to biases. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We used data from the CASCADE (Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe) multinational cohort collaboration of HIV-1 seroconverters. We analysed pre- and post-treatment data of patients with seroconversion dates estimated January 2003-March 2014 (n = 7600 for primary analysis) using a statistical model in which the characteristics of recovery in CD4 counts are determined by multiple predictive factors. Secondary analyses were performed incorporating uncertainty in the exact timing of seroconversion to allow more precise estimation of the benefit of very early treatment initiation. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: 'True' CD4 count at cART initiation was the strongest predictor of CD4 count beyond 3 years on cART. Allowing for lack of complete certainty in the date of seroconversion, CD4 recovery was more rapid for patients in whom treatment was initiated within 4 months. For a given CD4 count, higher viral load (VL) at initiation was strongly associated with higher post-treatment CD4 recovery. For other patient and drug characteristics, associations with recovery were statistically significant but small in magnitude. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: CD4 count at cART initiation is the most important factor in predicting post-treatment recovery, but VL provides substantial additional information. If cART is initiated in the first 4 months following seroconversion, recovery of CD4 counts appears to be more rapid.",1,train,276
37080600,"Since Vietnam America lost its domestic and international face and has needed to regain collective self- respect, a sense of purpose, direction, and to reconstruct a set of values which will guide the nation's contemporary and future political and economic agenda at home and abroad. Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was a perfect opportunity for America to accomplish this — to raise America's image from the ashes of despair, self- doubt, and low credibility in the world. After the invasion, President Saddam Hussein was ejected out of obscurity into the light of world curiosity and intrigue. Seen as the leader who dared to steal an entire country in daylight, who took hostages and created human shields, and then arrogantly brushed aside the world's outrage, the entire world seemed to want to understand not Saddam's politics, but his mind. As the world threatened Hussein with ejection from Kuwait, he not only grandiosely retorted with threats of burning the entire planet, but became increasingly brazen, emboldened, dangerous, and resolute. Saddam's self organization fuels the “Nebuchadnezzar Imperial Complex,” which operate within the malignant narcissistic paranoid personality. The Iraqi leader's dynamics dovetailed with “Gulf- Nam” — the American post- Vietnam failure syndrome. This study focuses on Saddam's personality dynamics as a violent leader in the Arab world.",0,train,212
25568243,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW ::: Impaired sodium excretion in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can drive fluid overload and hypertension and accelerate CKD progression. Diuretics reduce fluid overload but require residual kidney function to work. Adherence to dietary sodium restriction is generally poor. Here, we review an alternative pharmacologic strategy aimed at reducing sodium absorption from the gut. ::: ::: ::: RECENT FINDINGS ::: Genetic studies implicate the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) as the major absorptive sodium transporter. Pharmacologic inhibition of apically expressed gut NHE3 offers the potential of reducing sodium absorption and fluid overload independent of kidney function and with better safety than systemic drugs. Two small-molecule inhibitors of NHE3 (tenapanor and SAR218034) with minimal systemic exposure reduce urinary sodium and increase stool sodium in a dose-dependent manner in rodents, with similar results observed with tenapanor in humans. These molecules also reduce blood pressure in rat models of CKD (tenapanor) and hypertension (SAR218034). Clinical trials of tenapanor in patients with CKD-related disorders are ongoing. ::: ::: ::: SUMMARY ::: Pharmacologic inhibition of gut NHE3 may be a viable strategy for managing sodium load in patients with CKD or with sodium-sensitive hypertension in general. Ongoing clinical trials will shed further light on the potential benefits of this approach.",1,train,209

158634193,"The South China Sea Arbitration which has taken place recently with its final decision published in July 2016 was an action initiated by the Philippines against the People’s Republic of China in an attempt to oppose the latter’s claims of ‘historical rights’ in various maritime features in the South China Sea. The panel was constituted under Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Chinese Government opposed the constitution, admissibility and ruling of the entire arbitration. It has since put forward many counter claims to refute the validity of the decision reached. China’s primary concern inevitably lies with the implications of the decision on the ‘Nine-Dash Line’, a historic graphical boundary line that has appeared in the Chinese national atlas as early as 1914. This article will qualitatively dissect the decisions made by the arbitral tribunal from a historical perspective, taking into account diplomatic correspondences and authoritative theories in public international law. Ultimately, this article aims to ascertain the implications of the arbitral rulings on the claims of sovereignty of both countries, which remain the terminal concern of the international community.

54768100,"The study used the innovation system approach to ascertain the intensity and trends of linkages among key actors in the climate change and food security innovation system in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Data were collected through the use of semi structured interview schedule, key informant interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) and analyzed using percentages, mean scores and trend analysis. Only 1.8% of the farmers from Nigeria, 2.5% from Sierra Leone and 0.7% from Liberia possessed special training on climate change adaptation and food security issues. The presence of local collaboration among actors was higher in Nigeria than in Sierra Leone and Liberia. There was nonexistence of overseas linkages with majority (89.0% for Nigeria; 98.0 for Sierra Leone and 96.8% for Liberia) of the farmers across the three countries. The intensity of linkages / collaborations existing among actors in the enterprise domain, in the three countries, outweighs that with other domains, with higher collaborations existing among the small-scale farmers and famers’ associations. However, there was a perceived increase in the trend of linkage between farmers and R & D institutions in Nigeria between 2007 and 2009, with a linkage index of more than 2. There was also an increasing higher linkage index (of more than 2) between farmers and technology delivery institutions in Nigeria than in Sierra Leone and Liberia, but a low linkage index of less than 2 between farmers and policy making bodies for all the countries. Poor generation of innovations over the past ten years and poor domestic support for climate change adaptation and food security in the West African sub-region were identified. The study points to the need to intensify the collaboration efforts, between local and foreign partners, as this will bring about the generation of better and improved innovations on food security and adaptive measures.",1,train,301

26500768,"Although the waveform derived from a peripheral pulse monitor or pulse oximeter may resemble an arterialpressure waveform, it is in fact a visualization of blood volume change in transilluminated tissue caused by passage of blood: an indication of perfusion or bloodflow. Most currently available pulse oximeters indicate this flow, but few display it in usable form. Since adequate tissue blood flow is a prerequisite for normal metabolic activity, it is a parameter that should merit a place in standard anesthesia or intensive care monitors. That the peripheral tissue blood flow is not routinely displayed may be in part due to the difficulty in quantifying data obtained: flow is not accurately measured as simply as pressure, even by invasive means. It is in the pattern of the waveform that beat-to-beat changes in stroke volume can be better seen than measured, or in the interaction of ventilation and circulation that tests general circulatory performance. The origin and interpretation of these changes are discussed and illustrated with examples. We indicate how new physiological tests of autonomic function and cardiac preload can be developed using pulse plethysmography. The importance and application of the Valsalva effect on the waveform is emphasized. This effect is particularly applicable for monitoring adequate fluid loading and the action of vasodilator drugs, which are both important in anesthesia. Differences between the arterial pulse pressure wave and tissue flow wave are discussed, as well as the cause of certain artifacts, including the wandering dicrotic notch.",0,train,244
55178212,"To sustain its knowledge economic growth, Malaysian government had launched the K-Economy Master Plan in 2010; outlining the knowledge economy policy initiatives in supporting the knowledge based economy. The transition to knowledge based-economy, knowledge plays a governing role in leading the productivity and maintaining the economic performance growth. Equally important would be the factors that would contribute towards the knowledge creation. However, the literature indicates that very little attempts have been conducted to investigate factors that influence knowledge productivity. In Malaysia, the Administrative and Diplomatic Officers or PTD, are heavily involved in the development and implementation of the main policy makers of the federal government. However as to date, there are no mentions of any study exploring knowledge productivity of PTD. Against this background, this study intends to investigate the contributions of job characteristics towards knowledge productivity. In the process, it will propose a framework linking job characteristics and knowledge productivity. The proposed research method that will be employed will be a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The qualitative approach will use interview as the main data collection technique, while the quantitative approach will adopt the questionnaire. The qualitative approach will help the researcher to develop the framework that depicts the factors that contribute towards knowledge productivity among PTD. Based on this framework a questionnaire will be developed so as to collect quantitative data involving PTDs. The contribution of the study can be viewed from two perspectives i.e. theoretical and practical. From the theoretical perspective, the study will develop an empirical based framework while from the practical perspective the study will help to devise strategies for improving and enhancing knowledge productivity. The significant of the study is that, it will further improve knowledge productivity among PTDs who are mainly involved in executing the country's development strategies including strengthening the administrative functions, social infrastructures and also the performance of the country's economic growth in line with the country's National Key Results Area (NKRA).",1,train,323

Those who have studied the issue have generally found no effect. A number of those studies, however, were based on a population defined too broadly to indicate anything meaningful for the EITC population, while others seemed to overlook facets of their own data. I include a multiple regression using Current Population Survey Data cases in which family income corresponds to the phase-out range of EITC. Only in the phase-out range â€“ as beneficiaries lose part of their benefits as a percentage of income above the threshold amount â€“ would we expect a negative effect on hours worked.

To date, the UN has not developed a comprehensive mechanism to investigate and punish such violations. In order to comply with IHL and to uphold the UN’s mission of promoting international cooperation, the UN must establish a clear framework to enforce the law of war within its own peacekeeping and peace enforcement forces. This article will begin with an introduction to UN peace operations, highlighting some cases of alleged abuse. The second section will examine the applicability of IHL to the UN. First, the section will examine the nuances of IHL by describing the differences between international, non-international, and internationalized armed conflict. It will then demonstrate that the UN is bound by IHL.

It is attracting increasing interest for the production of biopharmaceuticals, due to its capability of performing posttranslational modifications. Traditionally, production processes with P. pastoris describe fed-batch processes based on feed forward regimes with a constant specific growth rate. However, this strategy does not consider physiological changes of the organism, bearing the risk of overfeeding and thus harming the cells. Recently, we introduced the specific substrate uptake rate as a novel physiological parameter to design fed-batch strategies for P. pastoris. We showed that by doing dynamic batch experiments strain specific parameters, which are needed to set up respective feeding profiles, can be easily determined. Furthermore we proved that dynamics during feeding directly affects productivity and product purity.

156693728,"Notions surrounding ‘creativity’ have become key elements of Dublin’s policy formation over the last decade. Predominantly, this policy focus has been influenced by Richard Florida’s ‘creative-class’ thesis. For Florida (2002), the future of urban economies revolves around the attraction and retention of the ‘creative class’. Loosely speaking, the ‘creative class’ comprises workers in fields such as the arts, academia, the sciences as well as the legal profession and business management. Florida suggests that in order to remain competitive, cities must promote the type of environment to which the ‘creative class’ is attracted because companies (and highly mobile investment capital) are attracted to where these individuals are located. This environment comprises city centre locations with high-quality amenities, such as bars, restaurants and good quality public space. Given the attraction of the city image projected by the ‘creative-class’ thesis, it has proved popular with city authorities on a global scale, and particularly in North America and Europe (Peck, 2005; Houston et al, 2008; Zimmerman, 2008). While the ‘creative-class’ concept emerged during a period of relative economic prosperity, it has proved a particularly resilient form of policy in the context of the global financial crisis. Indeed, in the example of Dublin, the influence of the ‘creative class’ has, if anything, taken on a greater significance during the economic downturn.",0,train,216

By means of numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis we determine the phase diagram in the plane that is spanned by the gap costs and the temperature. We use the most frequently used parameter set for protein alignment. The critical exponents that describe the parameter driven transition are found to be explicitly temperature dependent. Furthermore, we study the shape of the (free-) energy distribution close to the transition by rare-event simulations down to probabilities of the order $10^{-64}$. It is well known that, in the logarithmic region, the optimal score distribution (T=0) is described by a modified Gumbel distribution.

The evolutionary process has brought people together through flows of communication into global digital networks to an extent that scientists have started to talk of the rise of a new geological era called “Anthropocene”. The paper “Programming the State—Digital Technology and Institutional Design” focuses on political aspects of the on-going technological transformation bringing us into a digital society. The aim is to discuss the relation between political and technological change by applying historical institutional theory to explain and understand how ideas and ideology are embedded into digital political institutions. The discussion starts by explaining the basic concepts used in historical institutional theory such as path dependency and formative moments. I then turn to a theory of history formulated by R.G. Collingwood, as this help to understand how the formation of political institutions may be studied in terms of a design process. My argument is that in order to understand the design of political institutions we have to include the study of political ideology since ideologies serve as the design plan for specific institutional solutions. If we are to understand the logic of digitalization we have to be aware of which ideas that are embedded into digital technological solutions.

It distinguishes between four sets of rent—gifts of nature; innovation rents; exogenously defined rents; and market power—and three spheres of governance—setting the rules -“legislative governance”; implementing the rules -“executive governance”; and monitoring rules and sanctioning malfeasance -“judicial governance.” The exercise of governance power in GVCs over the generation, protection and appropriation of rents is considered though the lens of four sets of key GVC stakeholders—the corporate sector, civil society organizations, the nation state and supranational institutions. This general analysis is given flesh through three case studies: food-safety standards in GVCs; taxation policies and competition policies. In these sectors, the corporate sector is generally much more effective in governing rent generation and appropriation in the global operations of GVCs than are the three sets of non-corporate stakeholders. From this observation we offer a hypothesis that the capacity of non-corporate stakeholders, including national states, to govern GVCs is contingent upon the extent to which this coincides with the interest of the corporate sector. However, as noted, this balance of power between private and non-corporate actors is a contested terrain and dynamic in nature.",0,train,215

Analysis of curriculum documents from 28 OECD countries, including China and South Africa, reveals that although there is a prevalence of astronomy related content in most grades, incorporating Robotic Telescopes and Student Research into the regular science curriculum is limited by two interdependent factors. Firstly, the majority of curricula introduce astronomy-related concepts through a descriptive lens, with a focus on the “what?”, rather than the “how?” or “why?”. Secondly, astronomy in comparison to other topics gets very little time allocation. Robotic Telescopes provide teachers with enormous potential to teach students not only topics related to science, but also to afford students the opportunity to engage in “authentic science”.

16294021,"The objective of this study was to determine whether osteogenic matrix cell sheets (OMCS) could induce bone formation around grafted tendons, thereby enhancing early stage tendon to bone tunnel healing in skeletally mature male Japanese white rabbits. First, the osteogenic potential of rabbit OMCS was evaluated. Then, the OMCS were transplanted into the interface between the grafted tendon and the bone tunnel created at the tibia. Histological assessments and biomechanical tensile testing were performed after 3 weeks. The rabbit OMCS showed high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, positive staining of ALP, and osteogenic potential when transplanted subcutaneously with beta tricalcium phosphate disks. Newly formed bony walls and positive collagen type I staining were seen around the grafted tendon with OMCS transplantation, whereas such bony walls were thinner or less frequent without OMCS transplantation. Micro-computed tomography images showed significantly higher bone volume in the OMCS transplantation group. The pullout strength was significantly higher with OMCS (0.74 ± 0.23 N/mm(2)) than without OMCS (0.58 ± 0.15 N/mm(2)). These results show that OMCS enhance early tendon to bone tunnel healing. This method can be applied to cases requiring early tendon to bone tunnel healing after ligament reconstruction surgery.",1,train,194

In particular, contagion effects arising from cross-holdings between interconnected financial firms have been studied extensively. Drawing inspiration from the field of complex networks, these attempts are largely unaware of models and theories for credit risk of individual firms. Here, we note that recent network valuation models extend the seminal structural risk model of Merton (1974). Furthermore, we formally compute sensitivities to various risk factors -- commonly known as Greeks -- in a network context. In particular, we propose the network $\Delta$ as a quantitative measure of systemic risk and illustrate our findings on some numerical examples.",1,train,110

150777241,"Abstract : The U.S. military has historically played a critical role during post-conflict stability operations, contributing to the overall goal of achieving long term security and securing our strategic interests. With the potential for commitment of billions of dollars to infrastructure reconstruction in the future, we should apply the lessons of Operation Iraqi Freedom and take a comprehensive, integrated approach to reconstruction operations. After the investment of nearly four years and $24 billion in Iraq, it is clear that the U.S.-led rebuilding effort has fallen short and not contributed enough to accomplishing U.S. strategic objectives. This cannot be attributed to a lack of security alone. Our failure to conduct an initial assessment of Iraqi infrastructure; develop a master plan for rebuilding; and set benchmarks to gauge progress hamstrung the coalition's rebuilding efforts. Although the recently issued NSPD-44 gives the Department of State responsibility to lead and coordinate reconstruction activities, the military will play a critical role. This paper outlines specific reconstruction goals and tasks that the military, along with other USG agencies, must accomplish during the stabilizing, securing, transitioning and reconstructing phases of stability operations. Essential to long term success is the involvement of host nation engineers and officials in the rebuilding of their country, developing a sense of ownership.",1,train,210

This paper argues that the comprehensive reach and foundation of the human development and capability approach has a value independent from and additional to their practical outworkings, and yet also that operational specifications are both possible and vital to the further development of the approach. The paper begins with a thumbnail sketch of the core concepts of the capability approach, and supplements these with additional informational and principle requirements that Sen argues to be necessary for a more complete assessment of a state of affairs. It traces some important avenues along which the Human Development Reports and other empirical studies have operationalized certain aspects of Sen's capability approach. The paper then articulates further developments that might be expected, arguing that such developments must also build upon cutting edge research in other fields. It also identifies certain 'value judgments' that are inherent to the capability approach and should not be permanently dismissed by some methodological innovation.",0,train,182
145695740,"Background and Aim: The communication process includes both verbal and nonverbal elements. Nonverbal behavior or body language includes facial expression, eye contact, posture and prosody. Prosody conveys semantic or affective information to a listener. Nonetheless, so far in Iran no report on assessment of speech prosody comprehension in patients has ever been published. The aim of this study was to measure the validity and reliability of the prosody comprehension test specifically designed for the Persian language and culture. Methods: This study is a type of test development. 73 sentences were orated by 22 professional vocalists in eight different prosodies. A total of 6582 voices were prepared which were listened by 200, 18-30 year-old students and a voice specialist. Having the content validity calculated for all voices, 1473 voices were found to be unanimously agreed upon by all participants in terms of emotional status which were analyzed by a voice specialist. Eventually, 169 voices were selected for developing the prosody comprehension test including the following four subtests: none motional prosody discrimination, emotional discrimination, naming of prosody and naming conflicts. Reliability of the test was determined by performing the test on 32, 18-60 year-old normal people. Results: The designed test of comprehension prosody had 100% content validity ratio and 94% reliability and the correlation of test of prosody was 89% (p=0.001). Conclusion: This test in Persian language has appropriate validity and reliability and is appropriate for assessment of prosody comprehension.",1,train,238

These assumptions include the quantification and commensurability of learning, teaching, and scholarship, the necessity of assessment and legitimation of accountability regimes, and the naturalness and universality of competition within postsecondary education.

144200808,"In their 1993 essay on diaspora and identity, Daniel and Jonathan Boyarin reject “diaspora” as a site of persecution and fear and instead argue that “the [new] lesson of Diaspora, namely, that peoples and lands are not naturally and organically connected . . . can teach us that it is possible for a people to maintain its distinctive culture, its difference, without controlling land, a fortiori without controlling other people.” I argue that the Boyarins’ new “diaspora” has been incorporated into contemporary Jewish American humor and provides assimilated Jews a way to create humor in a multicultural world. The Boyarins’ diasporic thinking can be applied to diverse contemporary Jewish comedic texts like Roth’s “The Conversion of the Jews,” Englander’s “What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank,” and Auslander’s Hope, A Tragedy. Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, and Larry David also reject traditional forms of Jewish comedy (the need for group identity and solidarity in the face of suffering, persecution, genocide, powerlessness) in favor of an emancipated diaspora that maintains identity while it is outer directed and engages the Other. Although Jewish “diaspora” humor is traditionally associated with disenfranchisement, vulnerability and persecution, Daniel and Jonathan Boyarin view it as an opportunity for an increasingly powerful Jewish identity that benefits from what was once a liability: diaspora or geographical dis persion. By separating communal identity from land acquisition, Jews are able to maintain a sense of group particularity without the domination of the Other, thereby substituting cultural collaboration for confrontation. This version of diasporic thinking complements American egalitarianism at the same time that it expands the scope and affect of traditional Jewish humor. Although, in 1951, Irving Howe could not imagine how the traditional Jewish humor of the embattled European diaspora would translate into an enfranchised, empowered American idiom, I argue that in the hands of Philip Roth, Nathan Englander, and Shalom Auslander as well as popular artists like Jerry Seinfeld, Woody Allen, Larry David, and others, a new form of Jewish diasporic humor is not only thriving in America but",0,train,341

The authors asked Portuguese-speaking preschool children in Brazil (mean age 4 year 3 months) to spell 12 words. Monte Carlo tests were used to identify the 31 children whose writing was not based on spellings or sounds of the target words. Two and a half years later, the children took a standardized spelling test. The more closely the digram (two-letter sequence) frequencies in the preschool task correlated with those in children’s books, the better scores the children had in primary school, and the more preschoolers used letters from their own name, the lower their subsequent scores. Thus, preschoolers whose prephonological writing revealed attentiveness to the statistical properties of text subsequently performed better in conventional spelling. These analytic techniques may help in the early identification of children at risk for spelling difficulties.",1,train,146

Evidence is first presented that the null of unit root with drift (constant, linear, or nonlinear) can be rejected in favor of nonlinear trend stationarity for the variables. Then, Bierens' (2000) nonlinear co-trending test finds two common nonlinear trends among the variables. The trends are consistent with a standard money demand relationship. All unit root and co-trending test conclusions are based on size and power results from Monte Carlo simulations as well as on asymptotic critical values.

These image acquisition protocols are implemented with the aim of reducing motion artifacts that may be produced by the movement of the neonate's head during the scanning session. Furthermore, axons are not yet fully myelinated in these subjects. As a result, the water molecules' movements are not as constrained as in older brains, making it even harder to define structure using diffusion profiles. Here, we introduce a post-processing method that overcomes the difficulties described above, allowing the determination of reliable tracts in newborns. We tested our method using neonatal data and successfully extracted some of the limbic, association and commissural fibers, all of which are typically difficult to obtain by direct tractography. Geometrical and diffusion based features of the tracts are then utilized to compare premature babies to term babies.

53030383,"OMI/HTRA2 (high-temperature requirement serine protease A2) is a mitochondrial serine protease involved in several cellular processes, including autophagy, chaperone activity, and apoptosis. Few studies on the role of OMI/HTRA2 in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are available, but none on its relationship with the cholinergic system and neurotrophic factors as well as other AD-related proteins. In this study, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that AD patients had a higher cytosolic distribution of OMI/HTRA2 protein compared to controls. Quantitative analyses on brain extracts indicated a significant increase in the active form of OMI/HTRA2 in the AD brain. Activated OMI/HTRA2 protein positively correlated with stress-associated read-through acetylcholinesterase activity. In addition, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene expression, a receptor also known to be localized on the outer membrane of mitochondria, showed a strong correlation with OMI/HTRA2 gene expression in three different brain regions. Interestingly, the activated OMI/HTRA2 levels also correlated with the activity of the acetylcholine-biosynthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT); with levels of the neurotrophic factors, NGF and BDNF; with levels of the soluble fragments of amyloid precursor protein (APP); and with gene expression of the microtubule-associated protein tau in the examined brain regions. Overall, the results demonstrate increased levels of the mitochondrial serine protease OMI/HTRA2, and a coherent pattern of association between the activated form of OMI/HTRA2 and several key proteins involved in AD pathology.

To handle the interval nature of our outcome of interest, the earnings variable, we estimate interval regressions, as well as ordered probit models. We follow a threefold strategy to tackle potential endogeneity problems, as the model includes: controls for the worker's ability; country-specific fixed effects; the unemployment rate in the region of residence, which might be the benchmark respondents have in mind when reporting their perception of the national unemployment rate and which is known to influence regional wages. Results show that when subjective perceptions overstate the unemployment rate in the country, a one percentage point gap between the perceived and the actual unemployment rate reduces individual wages by 0.4 to 0.7 percent. We discuss a potential mechanism generating this result.

Through semi-structured focus group interviews with parents, teachers and students, data from the demographic space of the school revealed that despite the limitations in economic capital there was social and cultural capital in migrant families, which provided reinforcement for the realisation of various goals, especially through education and “hard work”. The students from migrant backgrounds had an opportunity to aspire and imagine a grand future because they were able to inhabit and negotiate the field of education more easily with the strong support from the family. So ethnicity and cultural background affected not only educational and vocational aspirations but also impacted on the imagination of the parents and students.",1,train,145
157511739,"The question of how partisanship is influenced by exogenous factors has been vigorously debated, yet this debate is less frequently noted in the literature on Latino partisanship. This study analyzes the 2006 Latino National Survey with geographic identifiers to explore how the political context of a county influences Latino partisan self-identification. There are a variety of reasons why the political environment might influence Latinos’ partisan choice. First, a substantial proportion of the adult Latino population in the United States is foreign-born, potentially lessening the influence of parental partisan socialization. Second, increased migration to areas outside the Southwest has exposed Latinos to new and different social, political, and economic environments. Using subgroup analysis, interactive logit models, and regression discontinuity, we find that the local political context influences the party attachment of Latino immigrants in predictable ways. However, for Latinos born in the United States, our analysis does not provide evidence of a causal connection between partisan environment and an individual's partisan identification.",0,train,161
157669384,"In a study about the music activities delivered by selected Victorian primary school classroom generalist teachers, the phrase ‘lost and found’ had several apt connotations. Firstly, music activities delivered by generalists were found to be ‘lost’ attributed to the minimal data kept at the government level about primary music education programs (Parliament of Victoria, 2013). A goal of the study was to document some of those seemingly missing music activities. Secondly, the generalists who delivered music activities in the course of day-to-day teaching, prospective participants in the study, were difficult to find. It appeared that generalists delivering music activities may indeed be ‘lost’ due to a lack of “skills and confidence” (Parliament of Victoria, 2013, p. 19) or submerged in the crowded curriculum (Parliament of Victoria, 2013). Through purposeful sampling, three participants were ‘found’ who demonstrated commitment and enthusiasm for delivering music activities. Thirdly, the findings revealed that the music learning outcomes inherent in the music activities delivered by participants were often de-emphasised or ‘lost’ in the integrated activities favoured by participants. Overall however, the findings indicated a variety of music activities delivered by participants and upon close examination, aspects of best practice pedagogy were ‘found’.",1,train,196
54672043,"Available statistical data offer valuable information on recent demographic changes and developments within European healthcare and welfare systems. The demographic evolution is expected to have considerable impact upon various, major aspects of the economic and social life in all European countries. The healthcare system plays an important role especially in the context of ageing societies, such as Germany. This paper focuses on the evolution of the prevention or rehabilitation service sector during the last years in Germany, analyzes the specific characteristics of the elderly patients being cared for in these facilities and underlines important aspects at the interface between (acute) hospital and geriatric rehabilitative care. Networking, integrated care services and models will be of even greater importance in the future demographic setting generating (most probably) increasing numbers and percentages of elderly, multimorbid hospitalized patients. More than this, the cooperation at regional level between acute geriatric hospital departments and geriatric rehabilitation facilities has become a mandatory quality criterion in the Free State of Bavaria. This paper presents and analyzes issues referring to a precise cooperation model (between acute and rehabilitative care) recommended for implementation even by the Free State of Bavaria while emphasizing several examples of good practice that have guaranteed the success of this cooperation model. The analysis of the main causes leading to longer length of stay (and thus ""delayed discharges"") for the elderly patients transferred to geriatric rehabilitation facilities within the reference model for acute-rehabilitative care provides important information and points at the existing potential for optimization in the acute hospital setting. Vicinity, tight communication and cooperation, early screening, implementation of standard procedures and case management are some of the activities that have contributed considerably to the improvement of the hospital length of stay and transfer management for elderly patients benefiting from (follow-up) inpatient geriatric rehabilitation services. The presented facts are important not only for the German health setting.",1,train,311
141749399,"Rapid changes in educational settings place pressure on teachers to update their professional knowledge and skills, which can be accomplished by their participation in continuous professional development (CPD) programmes. The notion that teachers are true lifelong learners implies that they should hold positive attitudes and values needed to excel in learning. However, information on how teachers value their learning is sparse. This paper examines the dimensions of value placed on learning by teachers who undertook further learning as part of their CPD. As professionals, teachers are workers; therefore, their learning context is inevitably career-oriented. Thus, a Learning Value Scale questionnaire was developed by adapting Super’s Work Values Inventory proposed by Super and Neville (1986). The respondents were 599 teachers categorised into four groups—three groups engaged in different types of learning programmes (Undergraduate (UG), Postgraduate (PG), and Generic), and the control group did not participate in any learning activities. The responses were subjected to Principal Component Analysis. Results show that teachers see learning in four dimensions which are conceptually meaningful for, or associate with, the values of Achievement, Humanitarian Concern, Status, and Career Security. Examination of individual item responses across groups reveals that items for economic and job promotion show a distinct difference between the UG and Generic groups. In light of these findings, the study discusses the systemic cultural factors that conditioned the teachers’ concept of the value of learning. This baseline data can help teacher educators to understand teachers’ identity as learners. The findings also suggest that policy makers should review their learning policy initiative, and teachers as implementers of education should reflect on their own practice of learning.

It supports Settler governance by following dominant political dynamics, and struggles to engage with Indigenous political ordering other than through British-European settler-colonial logics. In response, this article experiments with a dialogical approach to studying political science that is responsive to Indigenous frames of reference and attentive to the colonial political relationship that Indigenous and non-Indigenous people share. We first document and attempt to break with the structural politics of knowledge that conditions Australian political science. We then deploy an idiom for advancing macro-level and informal insights for knowing liberalism on the Australian continent. The final section outlines a selection of key challenging questions that Australian political science needs to address if it is to enter into more appropriate relations with Indigenous political ontology and peoples of the continent.",0,train,141

This study examines its effect on psychological and physical intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization, and hypothesizes this effect will be mediated through relationship satisfaction, communication quality and/or conflict resolution ability. A sample of 156 respondents participated in this study. Bias-corrected bootstrap analyses revealed indirect effects of preference discrepancy on psychological and physical violence victimization through conflict resolution. People with high preference discrepancy scores report lower conflict resolution abilities, and in turn, higher victimization rates. There was also a significant total effect of preference discrepancy on physical violence perpetration, suggesting high preference discrepancy increases the chance of using physical violence against one’s partner. Further investigation is thus recommended, to assess if preference discrepancy could function as an additional anchor in the prevention of IPV within couples.",1,train,148

152997167,"Abstract : This thesis explains the military relationship between the United States and Pakistan in the context of their divergent national security interests. During the Cold War, U.S. concerns focused on the global contest between democracy and communism. In this competition Pakistan was seen as an important ally. However, Pakistan viewed India as it primary threat and considered global ideological concerns as secondary in importance. At times, each country benefited from the other, but neither ever fully met the other's most important needs. The United States did not support Pakistan in its wars with India and Pakistan did not confront communism except to help oust Afghani governments non-compliant with Pakistan's interests. Pakistan's military held power for more than half of Pakistan's existence and became the U.S. key ally in South Asia. Pakistan's pursuit of nuclear weapons distanced U.S. relations in the post-Cold War environment. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 catapulted Pakistan's importance as an ally but at the cost of supporting a military regime and the erosion of a democratic government in Pakistan. This thesis argues that Pakistan's military now shares a relationship with the United States that builds regional stability but which may also hold political consequences in the United States.",0,train,204

Patterns are categorized using group-based trajectory modeling. Predictors of group membership are modeled. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: About half responding to all survey waves report functional limitation at least once over the study period. Movements in and out of functional limitation states are common. Between age 30 and 70, trajectories are categorized into four groups: 1) robust, 2) late onset, 3) early onset, and 4) recovery. Being married, living in a nuclear household, higher successful birth ratio, and higher education associate with favorable trajectories. More births, higher age at first birth, wealth, and urbanicity associate with less favorable trajectories. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Many possible routes into and out of functional limitation exist. The manifold patterns can be grouped into common trajectories. A number of earlier life characteristics associate with these trajectories. ::: ::: ::: CONTRIBUTION ::: This is the first analysis to ascertain common functional limitation trajectories and earlier life predictors among women as they age in a high fertility developing country setting.

The article draws upon recent scholarship regarding the international legal agreements adopted in 1924 (the London Accords) and 1925 (the Locarno Accords) to demonstrate their potential for a new form of European and international stability. This potential, however, remained constrained by the logic and limitations of the primacy of State sovereignty. Within this context, Kelsen’s Lecture sought to set the emerging international order within a unified legal framework of national and international positive law. This framework enabled Kelsen to identify two variants of legal monism, differentiated by the role of State sovereignty in the relationship between national and international law.

146634917,"This study describes about the portrayal of male dominance through domestic violence in the drama film entitled Lovelace (2013) by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, which is based on the true story of Linda Lovelace that is considered as a victim of domestic violence perpetrated by her husband, Chuck Traynor. This study discusses the male dominance phenomenon through domestic violence in patriarchal society. It positions woman as a secondary level to man. The implications of woman as the “other” and the secondary level are discussed using feminism theory by Simone de Beauvoir and using the Sexual Politics by Kate Millet as the supporting theory. The methodology that is used is qualitative textual analysis in order to analyze the narrative and non-narrative aspects as data of analysis to carry out the ideological meaning within the film. The aim of the analysis is to portray the domestic violence in the forms of physical violence, psychological or emotional abuse, sexual violence, and threat of physical or sexual violence perpetrated by Chuck Traynor that show the male dominance by patriarchal society. It also aims to show the existing portrayal of the sex industry and depict Linda’s struggle in dealing with domestic violence and the enslavement of the sex industry. However, the male dominance can happen because of traditional gender stereotypes and the term second sex victimizes the woman as sexual exploitation of man and tends to make woman struggles. By focusing on male dominance that occurred could highlight the issue of domestic violence experienced by woman in the film with its effects toward woman in order to reduce the number of domestic violence and gender discrimination in every field. The portrayal of the enslavement of the sex industry as a patriarchal product also shows how woman is treated as a sexual objectification which portrays her as a weak and submissive creature.",0,train,307

Despite major advantages, including shorter duration of operation, minimal blood loss and decreased postoperative pain, many surgeons still prefer laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy. It is likely that the unfamiliar anatomical environment, smaller working space and long learning curve impede implementation. The present study assessed the number of procedures required to fulfil the surgical learning curve for posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The first consecutive posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomies performed by four surgical teams from university centres in three different countries were analysed. The primary outcome measure was duration of operation. Secondary outcomes were conversion to an open or laparoscopic transperitoneal approach, complications and recovery time. The learning curve cumulative sum (LC-CUSUM) was used to assess the learning curves for each surgical team. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: A total of 181 surgical procedures performed by four surgical teams were analysed. The median age of the patients was 57 (range 15-84) years and 61·3 per cent were female. Median tumour size was 25 (range 4-85) mm. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics and tumour size between the teams. The median duration of operation was 89 (range 29-265) min. There were 35 perioperative and postoperative complications among the 181 patients (18·8 per cent); 17 of 27 postoperative complications were grade 1.

The most common clinical symptoms after discharge were a headache in the first group and a headache plus vertigo in the second group (n = 7, 25.0% vs. n = 4, 11.1%; P = 0.020). At the end of the follow-up, in the first group, 28 patients (100%) had a GOS of 5 and in the second group, 33 patients (91.7%) had a GOS of 5 and 3 patients (8.3%) had a GOS of 4, showing no statistically significant differences (P = 0.118). Conclusions: The results of this study showed that traumatic ICH patients with early discharge had fairly similar outcomes to patients with late discharge.",1,train,250
201343940,"Purpose The paper provides a case study of a capacity building project and critical reflection in relation to transitioning to a sustainable food city. Design/Methodology/Approach An action research approach was adopted involving two research initiatives; firstly, a survey to elicit stakeholders’ understanding of sustainable local food, with a view to creating a shared agenda and informing future strategic direction; and secondly a combination of research approaches, including paired discussions, generation of pictorial outputs and a workshop, aimed to inform the future vision and mission of the Partnership. Findings Collaboration with stakeholders through a variety of research initiatives has facilitated the development of a Sustainable Food City Partnership, with the overarching aim of achieving a transition towards a more sustainable food system. Moreover, collaboration has contributed to the transition of the Partnership to ensure sustainability and continuity after the initial funding stage. Research limitations/implications While universities have an important role to play in guiding direction and shaping new community initiatives for sustainability in their regions, the challenges, resources and time involved may be under-estimated; these projects take considerable time to yield fruit. Practical Implications The findings of the study will be of interest to those working in the community to promote education for sustainable development and better food systems. Originality/value This paper addresses a gap in the literature in relation to universities and their collaboration in multi-actor networks, in building capacity and contributing to local sustainability transitions.

Methods: Non-equivalent control group pretest and posttest design was used. The participants were men with chronic schizophrenia hospitalized in N mental hospital located in N city (29 in the experimental group and 30 in the control group). The program was provided 3 times a week for 8 weeks, 24 sessions each lasting 45~60 minutes. Effects of this program were evaluated using BMI, K-POMS-B, PANSS. The data were analyzed using percentage, x 2 -test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, paired t-test, t-test, and ANCOVA with SPSS 12.0 version. Results: After the aerobic exercise program, statistically significant decreases in BMI, depression, fatigue score of the K-POMS, and psychiatric symptoms were found for the experimental group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that aerobic exercise programs are an effective psychiatric nursing intervention to decrease BMI, general psychiatric symptoms and fatigue, and also to improve mood states. Therefore aerobic exercise program are suggested as a potential approach for reducing re-hospitalization and facilitating social readjustment for patients with schizophrenia.",1,train,189
30206887,"Across the United States, interest in computer science as a major is down, as are the number of Bachelor's degrees in computer science. While there are obvious factors like the dot com bust that may explain much of our communal enrollment crash over the last few years, anecdotal reports also suggest that the No Child Left Behind act of 2001 (NCLB), and specifically the fact that computer science is not an area that students are tested on, may be a factor in the decreased presence of computer science at the high school level. But how can we empirically separate the effect of the dot com bust from that of NCLB given the proximity in time of the two events? This paper presents a first attempt to do so: recognizing the fact that private schools are exempt from NCLB, it seems appropriate to compare public school students with their private school counterparts.

168936491,"Most university engineering degrees include elements of teamwork experience to a greater or lesser extent and students are frequently placed in positions of leadership. Few universities, however, actively develop leadership skills or provide targeted training as a primary objective within course modules. Leadership coaching is a competence that is outside the experience of most engineering academics and providing it offers a new challenge for them. This paper compares two models for teaching 'leadership', offered as options in the final-year of an undergraduate engineering programme. Both use methods far removed from the usual diet of lectures and examinations. One is focused around a semester-long activity where senior students take responsibility for a team of younger students undertaking an industrially-based project. It is supported by a series of activity-based workshops. The second has similar objectives but is very different in style; it encapsulates a three-day intensive outdoor management course that exemplifies team-work and leadership theory through hands-on activities and provides the main focus for precourse learning and post-course assignments. This paper describes the two variants and the philosophy that inspired them. A short survey reveals how a year-group of students responded to the different training methods and provides a comparison of the two educational models.",1,train,203

Data covering 2002-2011 from published financial statements of a panel of 75 manufacturing firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) are analyzed using three alternative regression methods; namely fixed effect, random effect, and one-step difference GMM. We find that working capital management is an important determinant of manufacturing performance in Nigeria. In particular, receivable conversion period and inventory conversion period are directly or positively related to manufacturing performance. On the other hand, payable deferral period, cash conversion cycle and the debt-equity ratio period are inversely or negatively related to manufacturing performance. Additionally, liquidity (measured as quick ratio) has no significant relationship with manufacturing performance. Accordingly, we recommend liberal debt and aggressive inventory management strategies together with the pursuit of optimum debt profile to improve Nigeriaâ€™s manufacturing performance.",1,train,147

Although children have been maltreated in the course of our entire history, since they have no knowledge of the wrong and the right, hence ‘interest theory’ of jurisprudence remains true. [1] Child abuse and neglect are serious global issues and can be physical, sexual or psychological. Many research studies have shown that children under the age group of 5-12 are at a higher risk of suffering from child abuse and neglect. The statistical analysis says that 40 million children become victims of child abuse all over the globe and 1,850 die due to extensive abuse and lack of affection and attention. An attempt has been made to differentiate the types of abuses and neglect, the signs and symptoms, the impact of the trauma on the well-being of the child. Drawing inferences from previous research works on the global issues, the paper has been prepared on the national context as the child sexual abuse is an under-reported offence in India. The study conducted by the Government of India in 2015 estimates the burden of sexual abuse which revealed shocking results and showed that every second child in the country was abused; among them, 52.94 per cent were boys and 47.06 per cent were girls. Highest sexual abuse was reported in Assam (52.27%) followed by Delhi (41%), Andhra Pradesh (33.87%) and Bihar (33.27%). [2] There is a causal connection between child abuse and pornography; specifically child pornography depraves and corrupts the young minds which pose more danger to the child abuse. However, arguments frequently presented to defend pornography; such dichotomy stands between law and morality.

115198890,"It takes years to learn the Thai dance movements and become an expert. A Thai dance master must train close together with his or her students to transfer tacit knowledge. However, there is a lack of teachers and tools for teaching Thai dance. A Thai dance training tool prototype has to be developed to help the dance students practice dance movement outside the class. The tool is developed to give feedback to Thai dance students on basic dancing movements and to get a better performance based on the feedback. The evaluation process for the Thai dance training tool is taken into consideration. The method is to compare the machine feedback points with the Thai dance expert perspective. The comparison method is using the t-test to get a p-value between two groups and the difference within the groups to provide an evidence of significant value. Therefore, this paper is focusing on comparing machine scores with Thai dance expert scores (scores for each body part and an overall score) with 2 groups of Thai dance movement (Group A & B). The result of both groups has shown significant and insignificant values which are irrelevant to the score given by the machine and by the expert. The insignificant result provides the knowledge for improving the evaluation process of the Thai dance training tool.",1,train,220

Our model is consistent with the life-cycle properties of Japan’s labor market, namely that the job separation and unemployment rates are U-shaped, whereas the job finding rate declines with age. We then conduct three experiments that are relevant to Japan: a decline in productivity, a removal of the firing costs, and a decline in the population growth. In the first two experiments, we find substantial changes to these three rates, where young workers tend to be the most affected.

In accord with the domain-specific model, positive social control was related to positive affect and negative social control was related to negative affect. In partial support of the mediational model, positive social control exerted both a direct and an indirect effect via positive affect on health behavior change and negative social control exerted both a direct and an indirect effect via negative affect on hiding unhealthy behavior.

154959620,"Social media content can spread quickly, particularly that generated by users themselves. This is a problem for businesses as user-generated content (UGC) often portrays brands negatively and, when mishandled, may turn into a crisis. This paper presents a framework for crisis management that incorporates insights from research on social media users' behaviour. It looks beyond specific platforms and tools, to develop general principles for communicating with social media users. The framework's relevance is illustrated via a widely publicised case of detrimental UGC. The paper proposes that, today, businesses need to identify relevant social media platforms, to monitor sentiment variances, and to go beyond simplistic metrics with content analysis. They also need to engage with online communities and the new influencers, and to respond quickly in a manner that is congruent with said social media platforms and their users' expectations. The paper extends the theoretical understanding of crisis management to consider the role of social media as both a cause and a solution to those crises.

The data available on their spontaneous signing is summarized here and possible reasons for the spontaneity discussed. Instructional techniques for promoting spontaneity are outlined, and implications of sign spontaneity for research are considered. Nonverbal children can learn to sign spontaneously to express their desires, to initiate social interaction, and to describe aspects of their world; they also sign egocentrically to guide their own behavior. This spontaneous signing, it is argued here, develops as an adaptation and extension of the behavior of goal-directed grasping to the tasks of social communication. To promote this spontaneity it is important to begin sign language instruction with the expression of desires, to de-emphasize imitation, and to use structured waiting. The developmental aspects of nonverbal children’s acquired spontaneity in signing suggest intriguing research possibilities.",0,train,140

We have analyzed in vivo the DNAse I footprinting of the 35S promoter in wild-type and mutant strains lacking one specific transcription factor at the time. In this way we were able to unambiguously attribute the protections by the CF and the UAF to their respective putative binding sites. In addition, we have found that in vivo a binding hierarchy exists, the UAF being necessary for CF binding. Because the CF footprinting is lost in mutants lacking a functional RNA polymerase I, we also conclude that the final step of preinitiation-complex assembly affects binding of the CF, stabilizing its contact with DNA.

49484140,"Introduction Resident financial health has been linked to wellness and resiliency, yet financial literacy among residents is highly variable. While some medical school curricula include budgeting and student loan education, content on managing finances as a resident is usually lacking. We sought to quantitatively assess residents' financial circumstances, needs, and interests to inform the design of a resident personal finance curriculum. Methods Surveys were sent to residents in eight specialties at an academic medical center. Likert-type responses allowed respondents to rate their level of comfort (1 = Very Uncomfortable, 7 = Very Comfortable) and interest (1 = Very Uninterested, 7 = Very Interested) in various personal finance topics including budgeting, loan repayment, disability insurance, life insurance, home buying, and retirement planning. Details regarding financial circumstances, including assets, liabilities, and insurance, were also collected. Results of questions that utilized a Likert-type scale are reported as median (interquartile range). Results Of 346 residents surveyed, 144 (41.6%) responded. Residents were from Internal Medicine (56, 38.9%), Pediatrics (34, 23.6%), Emergency Medicine (18, 12.5%), and other specialties (36, 25.0%). Ninety-one (63.2%) reported educational loans, with an average balance of $191,730. Credit card balances exceeding $3,000 were reported by 11 (7.6%) respondents. One-hundred-two (70.1%) reported emergency savings, but only 65 (45.1%) reported having a retirement account (average balance $27,608). Respondents rated highest comfort levels with budgeting (5[4-6]), and lowest level of comfort with disability insurance (2[2-4]) and home buying (2[2-5]). Interest in learning each topic was high (6[5-7]), with retirement planning (6[5-7]), investing (6[5-7]), and home buying (6[5-7]) the topics of highest interest.

First, images represent strategies used by therapists in order to simplify the most abstract theoretical concepts. Second, images provide a system according for organizing the information about a client and anticipate the patterns of client change. Within the theoretical frameworks of social representations and of goal directed action theory, the present study explores the metaphorical aspects linked with therapeutic knowledge. This study aims to reconstruct the social representations that therapists use to objectify their theoretical model. The present research relies on a qualitative methodology. The results show that therapists from different orientations rely on different metaphors although, in certain conditions, they tend to share a more general representational system.

The Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program hubs are uniquely suited to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations across universities and academic medical centers. This paper describes the activities at the Columbia University CTSA Program hub to address a current public health crisis, the opioid epidemic. Columbia's CTSA Program hub led a three-phase approach, based on the Conceptual Model of Transdisciplinary Scientific Collaboration as described by Stokols et al.: (1) a university-wide planning and brainstorming phase to identify key leaders across many domains who are influential in addressing the opioid epidemic, (2) a campus-wide and community outreach to identify all interested parties, and (3) ongoing targeted support for collaboration development. Preliminary metrics of success are interdisciplinary collaborations and grant funding. We describe recent examples of how interdisciplinary collaboration, academic-community partnership, and pilot funding contributed to the development and funding of innovative interdisciplinary research, including the New York site of the HEALing Communities initiative. The processes are now being used to support interdisciplinary approaches for other translational public health issues.",1,train,188

143778226,"Historic novel, besides its achievements, problems and the many debates on its typological assesment, represents the most studied type by critics worldwide. Along with European novel, the Historic Albanian novel is written on novel awereness, but the later, due to political causes, conserved this romantic spirit longer. Therefore it’s present nowadays not just for political issues, but because of existential ones. Besides other characteristics this type of novel reveals, it’s on our interest to bring to evidence the features it gained by some writers of the second half of the 20th century like: SabriGodo, Jusuf Buxhovi, Bilal Xhaferri, Ismail Kadare, Dhimiter Shuteriqi, Skender Drini, Mira Meksi, Ben Blushi etc. It’s obvious that in the modern hist.novel of the second half of the 20th century, critical awereness towards history is seen as realistic one. In the Balkans today’s novel represents the strengthening of the national conscience , whilst the European one represents the national crisis, the resistance to cosmopolitan issues as well as the concern on various types of ideology. The hist. Alb. novel of the beginning of the 21st century changes from being narrative to authentic fiction; therefore it enriches the Albanian novel through direct reference on historic truth. Kadare’s novel, which develops a new attitude towards history ; its parody on historical function as an opposition to censorship, makes out the most innovative example in this context. The typological mixture is a presentation of the inner development of our literature indicating structural changes due to actual social and cultural Albanian structure after the 90’s.

They are: (1) abolishing currency (which would also be a useful crime-fighting measure); (2) paying negative interest on currency by taxing currency; and (3) decoupling the numeraire from the currency/medium of exchange/means of payment and introducing an exchange rate between the numeraire and the currency which can be set to achieve a forward discount (expected depreciation) of the currency vis-a-vis the numeraire when the nominal interest rate in terms of the numeraire is set at a negative level for monetary policy purposes.,0,train,114
10985994,"Certain postoperative wounds are recognised to be associated with more complications than others and may be termed high-risk. Wound healing can be particularly challenging following high-energy trauma where wound necrosis and infection rates are high. Surgical incision for joint arthrodesis can also be considered high-risk as it requires extensive and invasive surgery and postoperative distal limb swelling and wound dehiscence are common. Recent human literature has investigated the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) over high-risk closed surgical incisions and beneficial effects have been noted including decreased drainage, decreased dehiscence and decreased infection rates. In a randomised, controlled study twenty cases undergoing distal limb high-energy fracture stabilisation or arthrodesis were randomised to NPWT or control groups. All cases had a modified Robert-Jones dressing applied for 72 h postoperatively and NPWT was applied for 24 h in the NPWT group. Morphometric assessment of limb circumference was performed at six sites preoperatively, 24 and 72 h postoperatively. Wound discharge was assessed at 24 and 72 h. Postoperative analgesia protocol was standardised and a Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Score (GCPS) carried out at 24, 48 and 72 h. Complications were noted and differences between groups were assessed. Percentage change in limb circumference between preoperative and 24 and 72 h postoperative measurements was significantly less at all sites for the NPWT group with exception of the joint proximal to the surgical site and the centre of the operated bone at 72 h. Median discharge score was lower in the NPWT group than the control group at 24 h. No significant differences in GCPS or complication rates were noted. Digital swelling and wound discharge were reduced when NPWT was employed for closed incision management.

This mind-map is an essential working tool that uses indexing features—such as author names—as reference points. The Harvard style (HS), in which citations in the text are made of names and years of publication and the references are listed in alphabetical order, actively helps to establish this mind-map. In our view, the Vancouver style (VS), in which citations in the text are numbers and the references are listed in order of appearance within the text, does not enhance the formation of a mind-map in a similar way and makes detections of incongruity between the reader’s mind-map and the text more difficult. In an ideal academic world, HS would be used because of these two effects: constant education of and easy quality control by the scientific reader. Although VS reduces printing space and allows easier reading for less academically trained readers, scientific readers may find this style difficult when trying to check and verify sources. For reviewers, who cannot opt not to make such checks, VS is even more tedious. We advocate that journals using VS in print should use HS for the reviewing process; further, in the final printed version, the references should be numbered and listed alphabetically rather than according to the order in which they are cited.

Selected self- reported HBCs in the past 12 months by BMI category were examined in this secondary analysis of the Canadian Community Health Survey 4.1. These HBCs included increased sports/exercise, weight loss and improved eating habits. Barriers to HBC were also examined. Results: Our final sample was n = 111 449. Overall, 58% of respondents had made an HBC, with increased sports/exercise as the most important HBC in 29% of the sample, followed by improved eating habits (10%) and weight loss (7%). Half (51%) experienced barriers to HBC; lack of will power was most commonly cited, followed by work and family responsibilities. Obese respondents reported HBC more frequently than normal-weight respondents (60% vs. 55%), but the prevalence of increased sports/ exercise and improved eating habits was similar across BMI categories. Regression models accounted for only 6%-10% of the total variance. Conclusion: That a majority of respondents had made at least one HBC bodes well for positively shifting population health. Additional work to further characterize the population, and to improve on population indicators, is needed to assess the impact of health promotion/disease prevention efforts.

142102705,"This article explores the impact of varied migration trajectories and settlement experiences on the ways in which diaspora Croats have engaged with the homeland and with each other. The pre-migration experiences of Croats over the past century, spanning imperial and fascist periods, socialism, the Yugoslav Wars of Succession, and independence, combined with the struggles and challenges of life in Canada, have all but defined the lives of diaspora Croats for generations. This is reflected not only in the particularities of different migration waves, opportunity structures, and other barometers of diaspora adaptation but in the effects of major upheavals and transformations in the “place of origin,” variously defined as empire, nation, republic, region, or domovina (homeland). Disparities among and between different generations of Croats are typically conceived of as political/ideological. This tendency, though driven largely by the tumultuous history of the former Yugoslavia, overlooks the complex dynamics underlying significant social, cultural, and other conflicts and contestations within diaspora Croat communities, many of which were on full display during the Homeland War, a time when the “thousand-year-old dream” of Croatian independence was to unite all Croats globally.

153464347,"During the past years, rare diseases have been one of the main themes on the European Union’s agenda. The reason for this theme being highlighted is the excellent exchange of knowledge between EU policy makers and the relevant patient communities. The former negligence has been caused by the apparent low patient numbers. The definition of a rare disease in Europe contains, that there are less than five patients out of a total population of 10000 persons suffering from this disease. Taking the total of all patients, suffering from rare diseases, it becomes a different number. An estimated 30 million EU citizens are suffering from a rare disease. This tells us that rare diseases are actually not exactly rare. Due to the great part of the population,which is affected, we have a social obligation to prioritise on this matter. Furthermore, the type of health conditions deserves a strong focus. The European Union, and notably the European Parliament, has made significant progress towards the provision of a political framework, which would define rare diseases and provide incentives for the research and development of medicines. The EU Orphan Medicines Regulation, adopted in 1999, was a political milestone in the prioritisation of rare diseases. It has provided the European Union with a clear competence in refining this topic. It was this legislation, which created incentives for medical manufacturers to develop products, furthermore, they generated a market exclusivity going beyond patent protection and a fee waiver for the evaluation and registration process of specialized products. The establishment of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) in 1995, meant the foundation of a centralised body, which can appropriately deal with the necessary central registration of available and registered medicines. This has been a great success story. Since then, 639 products have been registered with the European Medicines Agency.

8974241,"Fisheries are subject to a deep-rooted problem of economic inefficiency, often referred to as the fisheries problem. The fisheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones. Which institutions are most appropriate depends on the social objectives of the fisheries. There are strong economic arguments for the view that there should be only a single objective, namely to maximize the present value of the flow of benefits from the fisheries. In reality, different interest groups often push for several, often conflicting, objectives. In that case a multi-objective programming approach may be appropriate. A set of institutions to manage fisheries is referred to as the fisheries management regime. The fisheries management regime consists of a (i) fisheries management system, (ii) fisheries enforcement system and (iii) fisheries judicial system. Each one of these has to be appropriately designed and implemented. The efficacy of the overall fisheries management regime cannot be greater than that of its weakest link. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to keep an eye on the cost of fisheries management. Global evidence suggests that the cost of fisheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. The problem, thus, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the fisheries management regime and its cost of design, implementation and operation. The problem of fisheries management is by its nature multidisciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, economics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring powerful modelling and calculation techniques.

Reading time differences between more difficult and less difficult reduced relative sentences (e.g., The hangman executed by the government was convicted of treason vs. The martyr executed by the government was convicted of treason ) have been interpreted as reflecting syntactic disambiguation processes. In this article, we point out that there exists a possible alternative interpretation of the differences, namely, that reading times are longer for the more difficult sentences because the information in their relative clauses mismatches a reader’s general knowledge of how events typically occur in the world or how they are typically referenced in discourse. Under this interpretation, the differences in reading times do not have their bases in disambiguation processing.",0,train,165

The plasma concentration of verapamil was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and general peripheral vascular resistance (GPVR) were measured using integral rheography according to Tishchenko (Mingograf-410, Russia); blood pressure (BP) was measured by Korotkoff sounds. Analysis of verapamil pharmacokinetics in both experiments showed identity of the averaged curve profiles that did not differ significantly. The pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable. Based on hemodynamics analysis, HR elevation 1 h after verapamil administration was the most common reaction in both experiments; a short CO rise and GPVR decrease were observed in experiment 2 1 h after administration. These hemodynamic shifts were not pathologic and did not deviate from the physiological range in healthy people; changes in verapamil pharmacokinetics were also not detected. These findings provide the grounds to recommend verapamil for rational pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases that may develop in piloted space missions.",0,train,197
158555672,"Establishing an energy monitoring and management methodology is a quintessential milestone for informed energy savings decision making as well as for effectively reducing the cost and the environmental impact of shipping operations. In this study, a novel systematic methodology is proposed for the energy management of the ship propulsion engine, which is the largest ship energy producer. The methodology employs a combination of tools including statistical analysis, predicting the engine air flow via compressor modelling and energy and exergy analyses, whereas its output includes the engine operating profile, the most frequently occurring propeller curves and the engine most frequent operating points, the key performance indicators for quantitatively assessing the recorded parameters quality as well as the energy and exergy flows and exergy destruction of the engine components. The methodology is implemented for three case studies for a very large crude carrier, a container ship and a bulk carrier, for which recorded data were available by using different monitoring techniques from either noon reports of automatic data acquisition systems. The derived results provide the engine operating profile demonstrating that the investigated vessels were operating in slow steaming conditions with a lower engine efficiency associated with a greater exhaust gas wasted energy. The measured data analysis demonstrates the better quality of the data recorded by automated monitoring systems and pinpoint maintenance issues of the engine components. Lastly, the exergy analysis results demonstrate that the exhaust gas and jacket cooling water provide the greater exergy flows rendering them attractive for energy saving initiatives, whereas the engine block, compressor and turbine are the engine components with the greater exergy destruction, thus requiring closing monitoring for timely identifying mitigating measures.",0,train,275

The sample consisted of 200 college students (60.5% female, 39.5% male) who completed a revised version of the Conflict Tactics Scales and a self-labeling measure of sibling violence. Findings indicated that while the vast majority of the sample had experienced sibling violence, they utilized terminology in a manner that failed to recognize their experiences as a form of violence. When the data were classified according to gender and level of violence within the sibling relationship, quantitative analysis indicated a difference in terminology. In an attempt to interpret these results from the theoretical perspective of discourse as an aspect of social constructivism it was postulated that the study identified both a dominant discourse that renders physical violence among siblings invisible and several subordinate discourses by which individuals reflect their varying characteristics. It was suggested that future research utilize qualitative analysis to clarify and expand upon this interpretation.",0,train,163

It considers Australia’s history of failing to protect Indigenous peoples from racially discriminatory legislation, and the problem of cultural racism which remains in contemporary law and policy. The article evaluates recommendations of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples which refer to the notion of ‘advancement’ and prohibition of racial discrimination unless it is for the purpose of ‘overcoming disadvantage’. These issues are critically analysed in light of current law and policy intended to be beneficial for Australia’s First Peoples: the new Indigenous Advancement Strategy announced in the 2014-15 Federal Budget; and the Improving School Enrollment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure (‘SEAM’). These matters suggest that more robust constitutional protection of the rights of Indigenous peoples is necessary to guard against racial discrimination that can be entrenched in purportedly benevolent law and policy.",1,train,157

The study contributes to the literature on persistence in productivity along four main lines. First, it develops a conceptual framework that links the persistence in productivity performance to persistence at the firm level in innovative activities, which include the adoption and imitation of innovations introduced by third parties. Second, it shows how the internal characteristics of companies, including the propensity of managers to leverage dynamic capabilities, can shape the dynamics of the process. Third, it confirms that external factors, such as the access to local pools of knowledge and the dynamics of economic activity, have relevant effects on persistence and shape its evolution along its path. Fourth, the use of Multiple Transition Probability Matrices (MTPMs) and the subsequent econometric analysis provides substantial evidence on the relevance of the crucial distinction, within non-ergodic dynamics, between past dependent processes, characterized by full hysteretic irrever sibility, and path dependent processes in which events that take place along the process may affect its direction and pace.",0,train,188

213618586,"Visual Art Education in Ghana and the world over has been structured to give a holistic training to the student with emphasis on hands on practical skills acquisition. It focuses on creativity and innovativeness towards the production of high quality artefacts to fulfill societal needs. It is line with this mandate that the Visual Art curriculum has been crafted to refine and train students in the various art disciplines such as Textiles, Sculpture, Ceramics, Leather Work, Jewellery, Basketry and Graphic Design, just to mention a few. However, certain developments in recent times militate against the realization of this mandate. The craze for Graphic Design at the expense of other art subjects has almost reached its peak. 8 out of every 10 Visual Art students in the Tertiary and Senior High Schools prefer to offer Graphic Design. This unfortunate development has left most of the other art related subjects with few students. In most of the Senior High Schools in Ghana, the other art subjects have been scrapped leaving Graphic Design, General Knowledge in Art and a 3 dimensional art subject as the (subject combination). As a result, most of the teachers who teach the other art related subjects have become redundant except a few who teach General Knowledge in Art. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the cause of the problem and to proffer solutions. The study adopted the Purposive Sampling Technique. The sample population was made up of two-hundred and ten (210) respondents. The main research tools employed to collect data for the study were questionnaire and interview. A major finding of the study is that most respondents prefer Graphic Design because of its computer relatedness, general appeal and employment prospects.

However, when he is confronted with the skepticism of one of the officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport investigating the ship’s sinking, Pi provides an alternative version of his tale of survival, a version that replaces animals with people. Pi then puts a question to the investigators: “So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can’t prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?” When both officials choose the story with animals, Pi replies, “Thank you. And so it goes with God” (352). 3 Although reviewers of Life of Pi are, without exception, warm in their praise of Martel’s storytelling abilities, they have found his treatment of religion unpersuasive. As Peter Whittaker succinctly puts it: “This wonderful book did not make me believe in God but it did reinforce my faith in the considerable redemptive powers of fiction” (33).2 But this is precisely Martel’s point. He is not out to prove the existence of God, but rather to justify a belief in God’s existence. Martel’s position is a post-modernist one, from the perspective of which God’s existence has the same status in relation to truth and reality as Pi’s experience of shipwreck. Agnostics, Pi tells us, “lack imagination and miss the better story” (70). God’s existence, in other words, is a matter neither of fact nor of faith, but rather is a better story than the one told by those who doubt or deny God’s existence.",0,train,312

214294174,"In many higher learning institutions and Health Professions Education (HPE) programmes in particular, there exists varying standard setting methods for assessment, certification and graduation of students’ academic performance. In Zambia, the historic arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard is predominant in most health professions’ training programmes. Scientific validation of this practice, however, remains scarce. The aim of this study was to compare the academic performance on the historic arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard to the Grade Point Average (GPA) score attainment for pharmacy students examined between 2013 and 2017 at the University of Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 445 randomly selected final examination results for undergraduate pharmacy students examined between 2013 and 2017 at the University of Zambia. The data was analysed using Stata 13 and GraphPad Prism 5. For all the statistical tests conducted, normality of the data was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. There was statistically significant difference between the historic arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard and the course-specific examination composite score attainment in all the courses (P<0.0001). ::: Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference between the examinees’ GPA score attained and the acceptable GPA score of 3.0 (Median GPA 1.75; IQR: 0.75-2.25 and 1.67; IQR: 1.0-2.0) for the fourth and fifth-year examinees respectively). The comparison of the academic performance on the arbitrary 50% pass-fail standard and GPA score attainment for pharmacy students revealed that despite students demonstrating ability to attain high course-specific composite scores using the arbitrary set 50% pass-fail standard, the attained median GPA score was statistically significantly less than the minimum acceptable GPA score of 3.0. While the 50% pass-fail standards’ precision to detect academic performance maybe questioned, the findings suggests that the incorporation of a credit point and GPA system for making assessment decisions to rate students, certification and graduation requirements in Health Professions Education may offer better precision and prediction to detect academic performance and competency attainment.",1,train,319

Academics perceive a decrease in the control over their own work due to the increasing presence of non-academic managers. The presence of new public management and managerialism has also been apparent in Portugal since the end of the 90’s. Several studies have been developed to understand the impact of these changes, but few of them concentrate on the administrative side. The aim of this paper is to examine the changing landscape of professional boundaries in higher education institutions in a binary system like the Portuguese one. Our main finding is that even though non-teaching staff are nowadays recognised as more qualified and more relevant even in terms of the visibility of their work, the traditional roles assigned to both the teaching and non-teaching staff are still pre-dominant, especially in terms of the clearly asymmetrical power relations between these two groups.",0,train,164

In this paper I argue that politicization provides a useful springboard for remedying democratic deficits at the EU and global level.

The paper unpacks what politicization is and how it might relate to democratic legitimacy. It then argues that problems surrounding representation – in particular the constructivist view of representation – complicates this relationship. Significantly the notion of mobilization generates suspicions of democratic representational legitimacy.

In broad terms, we can distinguish at least two major traditions which have developed more or less in parallel directions and in increasing interaction with one another. There is the older American tradition of “borderlands studies” that has gained new ground and forms today an established academic institution around the scholarly organization Association of Borderlands Studies (ABS) with its regular conferences and publications, most notably the Journal of Borderlands Studies (JBS). In this review I will concentrate on the more novel European based research tradition which has partly gained inspiration from the American scholarly discussion and partly opened new research directions, with certain influence on the broader international research community. This tradition is perhaps best known through the series of Border Regions in Transition (BRIT) conferences and the publications linked to them. Since the first gathering in Berlin in 1994, there have been ten BRIT conferences organized in Finland, the U.S., India, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Poland, Canada and Chile.

Under this approach, if a state permits lawyers to review inadvertently disclosed privileged documents, the jurisdiction should also permit lawyers to review the metadata contained in electronic documents. In contrast, if a jurisdiction prohibits the review of misdirected privileged documents, the state should ban metadata mining, but only when recipients have reason to believe that the metadata contains protected information.",0,train,146

Their strategic localization at the site of pathogen entry makes them particularly susceptible to initial viral invasion. Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) belong to the Paramyxoviridae family, within the Pneumovirus and Metapneumovirus genera, respectively. hRSV and hMPV are significant human respiratory pathogens that cause similar clinical manifestations and affect many of the same subpopulations. However, they differentially activate the host immune response, including DC, which represents a fundamental link between the innate and adaptive immune response. In this review, the role of DC in the immune response against hRSV and hMPV infections, as well as the inhibitory effects of these paramyxoviruses on the DC immunity will be discussed.",0,train,137

Technological progress has increased the importance of the international division of labor and of global production and distribution networks. Multinational corporatios have been a driving force behind these developments. As a transition economy, Poland provides an interesting case for study, as its sudden opening to foreign investment after a long period of isolation allows the process of integratio into global networks to be studies more clearly. Using Poland as a case study, the authors study multinational corporatios'role in integrating a host country into the increasingly international division of labor. They provide evidence that inflows of foreign direct investment are increasing Poland's participation in global production and distribution networks. They conclude that because of the large volume of foreign direct investment inflows expected in Poland in the near future, Poland's exports--driven by fragmented production production--will continue to expand at even faster rates than observed there recently.",0,train,188

This research, however, compares concept mapping to tutorial sheets strategy in teaching circular and rotational motion. A sample of 70 students participated in the experiment. An equivalent number of 35 students were assigned to the control and experimental group. The control group used tutorial sheets while the experimental group used concept mapping. A pre-test and post-test was administered to the two groups. A t-test was used to compare the means of the group’s test scores. The mean score for the experimental group’s post test was higher than the mean score of the control group. This showed that concept mapping was more effective than the tutorial sheet strategy.

155900049,"ICWA is one of the foundational laws of federal Indian law, but it usually arises in the broader public consciousness when there is a voluntary adoption subject to the law. Recently, the law was subject to Supreme Court review in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. A heart-wrenching case, but ICWA is far more regularly applied in abuse and neglect cases. Any involuntary removal of an American Indian child, as defined by the Act, requires the application of ICWA. While cases of voluntary adoptions designed to thwart the requirements of ICWA require constant vigilance from states and tribes, the law provides broader protections for those families in the state child welfare system. This article posits one way to both collect data about abuse and neglect compliance within the framework of ICWA, and increase that compliance through collaborative change to the systems. QUICWA, a project by the Minneapolis American Indian Center, consists of a group of interested stakeholders who have created a checklist to measure what happens in each individual hearing where the court must apply ICWA. While other groups, such as the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, use a different checklist format, the goal of the projects are similar — to find ways to increase compliance with ICWA. Funded in collaboration with Casey Family Programs, law schools and social work programs in key states have started observing ICWA hearings using the QUICWA checklist. In Michigan, the Michigan State University College of Law has observed ICWA hearings in three counties, using law students as observers. Though family law is driven by narrative, collecting data is vital to identify patterns surrounding fairness and due process in the individual stories",0,train,279

Discovering a discernible pattern to these errors is a critical step toward creating procedures that reduce the occurrence of these tragic mistakes. To these ends, we hypothesized that both the victims’ race and the victims’ sex may impact eyewitness identification for perpetrators of certain crime types. In two experiments, we demonstrated that a Black male drive-by shooter’s level of phenotypic stereotypicality is accurately identified by eyewitnesses only when the victims are Black males. Specifically, when eyewitnesses believe the victims are White or female, the drive-by shooter’s level of Black phenotypic stereotypicality is falsely elevated. In contrast, when a Black male perpetrator is suspected of committing a stereotypically non-Black crime (i.e., serial killing), the perpetrator’s level of phenotypic stereotypicality is accurately identified regardless of the victims’ race or sex.",0,train,140

Hence, the aim of RM is to periodically update the prices in response to market demands, by charging different fares to different customers for a same resource. We evaluate the effectiveness of RM and show that by segmenting customers, charging them with different pricing schemes and protecting resources for them who are willing to pay more, will result in an increase of total revenue for that resource.

152364019,"Informational privacy is the ability to determine for yourself when and how others may collect and use your information. Adequate informational privacy requires a sufficiently broad ability to give or withhold free and informed consent to proposed uses.Notice and Choice (sometimes also called “notice and consent”) is the current paradigm for consent online. The Notice is a presentation of terms, typically in a privacy policy or terms of use agreement. The Choice is an action signifying acceptance of the terms, typically clicking on an “I agree” button, or simply using the website. Recent reports by the Federal Trade Commission explicitly endorse the Notice and Choice approach (and provide guidelines for its implementation). When the Notice contains information about data collection and use, the argument for Notice and Choice rests on two claims. First: a fully adequate implementation of the paradigm would ensure that website visitors can give free and informed consent to data collection and use practices. Second: the combined effect of all the individual decisions is an acceptable overall tradeoff between privacy and the benefits of collecting and using consumers’ data. There are (we contend) decisive critiques of both claims. So why do policy makers and privacy advocates continue to endorse Notice and Choice?Most likely, they see no need to seek an alternative. We find the critique of Notice and Choice conclusive, but our assessment is far from widely shared — and understandably so. Criticisms of Notice and Choice are scattered over several articles and books. No one has unified them and answered the obvious counterarguments. We do so. Making the critique plain, however, is not enough to ensure that policy makers turn to a viable alternative. The critiques are entirely negative; they do not offer any alternative to Notice and Choice. We offer an alternative: informational norms. When appropriate informational norms govern online data collection and use, they both ensure that visitors give free and informed consent to those practices, and yield an acceptable overall tradeoff between protecting privacy and the benefits of processing information. A fundamental difficulty is the lack of norms. Rapid advances in information processing technology have fueled new business models, and the rapid development has outpaced the slow evolution of norms. Notice and Choice cannot be pressed into service to remedy this lack. It is necessary to develop new norms.",0,train,386

Historically, Pakistan relied on both American and Chinese security assistance in balancing against India while India relied more on the former Soviet Union and the US in its balancing game against Pakistan. As current geopolitical dynamics unfold with the US pivot to Asia, the rivalry and competition between the US and China is intensifying, bringing with it a similar dynamic in South Asia as Pakistan moves closer to China and India consolidates its alliance with the US.

This “virtuous cycle” of costly contributions to group efforts and enhanced standing in the group shows one way in which individuals’ prosocial behaviors are socially constructed, a consequence of individuals’ basic concern for what others think of them.

In addition to the underlying technical considerations, this paper describes the difference between communication in general and public relations and specifically examines public involvement in recycling. Through the use of examples, we look at the targeted users and typical media employed. Furthermore, we analyzes the development of public involvement. The examples show that public relations for recycling strategies relies to a great extent on attitudes, habits, and access to the target group. Thus, standardized procedures cannot be developed. For these reasons, public relation activities must be planned carefully and professionally and include an analysis of the target group, choice of media, and verification of success.",0,train,157
167500892,"This paper argues for three basic changes in the model of airport security that have been employed in the United States since the passage of the Air Transportation Security Act (ATSA) legislation in 2001. The changes are to: (1) remove the Transportation Safety Administration's (TSA’s) conflict of interest by making it the policy-maker and regulator, but not the provider, of airport screening; (2) desolve screening responsibility to the airport level, under the supervision of the TSA’s Federal Security Director in each case; and (3) shift the paradigm from an equal-risk model to a genuinely risk-based model of airport security. These changes would improve airport security in many ways. They would target more of the available resources (both people and equipment) toward those passengers who pose relatively greater risk of harm, thereby getting more bang for the buck. By making all on-airport security functions the responsibility of the airport, this approach would lead to a more integrated approach, with the Federal Security Director (FSD) supervising everything.",0,train,165

Here, a critical overview of soft robotic grippers is presented, covering different material sets, physical principles, and device architectures. Soft gripping can be categorized into three technologies, enabling grasping by: a) actuation, b) controlled stiffness, and c) controlled adhesion. A comprehensive review of each type is presented. Compared to rigid grippers, end-effectors fabricated from flexible and soft components can often grasp or manipulate a larger variety of objects. Such grippers are an example of morphological computation, where control complexity is greatly reduced by material softness and mechanical compliance. Advanced materials and soft components, in particular silicone elastomers, shape memory materials, and active polymers and gels, are increasingly investigated for the design of lighter, simpler, and more universal grippers, using the inherent functionality of the materials. Embedding stretchable distributed sensors in or on soft grippers greatly enhances the ways in which the grippers interact with objects. Challenges for soft grippers include miniaturization, robustness, speed, integration of sensing, and control.

Meanwhile, we constructed artificial islet tissue by compound culturing the pancreatic stem cells and the fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane and explored the function of artificial islets in diabetic nude mice. Methods Pancreatic stem cells were cultured on the fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane in dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing activin-A, β-catenin, and exendin-4. The differentiated pancreatic stem cells combined with modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane were implanted subcutaneously in diabetic nude mice. The function of artificial islet tissue was explored by detecting blood levels of glucose and insulin in diabetic nude mice. Moreover, the proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic stem cells on modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane as well as the changes on the tissue structure of artificial islets were investigated by immunofluorescence and haematoxylin and eosin staining. Results The pancreatic stem cells differentiated into islet-like cells and secreted insulin when cultured on fibroblast-modified polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane. Furthermore, when the artificial islet tissues were implanted into diabetic nude mice, the pancreatic stem cells combined with polylactic- co-glycolic acid membrane modified by fibroblasts proliferated, differentiated, and secreted insulin to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic nude mice. Conclusion Pancreatic stem cells can be induced to differentiate into islet-like cells in vitro. In vivo, the artificial islet tissue can effectively regulate the blood glucose level in nude mice within a short period. However, as time increased, the structure of the artificial islets was destroyed due to the erosion of blood cells that resulted in the gradual loss of artificial islet function.",0,train,276

In Quebec, an increase in the number of severe iGASd cases has recently been observed. Because of the inter-individual variability in the severity of iGASd, a hereditary predisposition to invasive disease can be suspected. Given that iGASd occurs in MyD88- and IRAK4-deficient patients, although rarely, the increasing frequency of iGASd in the population of French-Canadian children may be associated with a deficiency in the host’s innate immune response. In this report, we assessed the influence of: (i) bacterial genotype and virulence factors, (ii) immune-cellular features, and (iii) Myd88/IRAK4-dependent response to GAS in vitro on the susceptibility to iGASd in a paediatric cohort of 16 children: 11 French-Canadian and 5 from diverse origin. GAS virulence factors and genotype are not implicated in the susceptibility toward iGASd, and cellular and MyD88/IRAK4 deficiencies are excluded in our patients. Although it has been shown that the MyD88/IRAK4-dependent signal is involved in the response to invasive GAS, our data indicates that a MyD88/IRAK4-mediated signalling defect is not the main factor responsible for the susceptibility to severe iGASd in a paediatric population from the province of Quebec.",0,train,201

The author discusses important concepts central to the nature and understanding of economics as understood by the Austrians, such as: the importance of time preference, economics as a learning system, the importance of entrepreneurialism, value determination, scarcity, the fallacy of the concept of equilibrium, human action and Praxeology, the misapplication of the scientific method and scientism to economics as a social study along with a discussion concerning the relative application of econometrics to the field of study.

The Panama Papers offer compelling evidence of something long suspected but difficult to prove for lack of transparency — even though asset-offshoring techniques may be used for legitimate purposes, they are, in fact, too often abused as a cover for criminal activity and tax evasion. In response to the leak, the U.S. Department of Justice and several foreign law enforcement agencies opened investigations into the financial improprieties uncovered by the Panama Papers.

16129476,"German law guaranteeing works councils is not a datum. The thrust of legislation has changed significantly on a number of occasions since 1920. The most recent legal change in the form of the Works Constitution Reform Act marks a controversial swing in favor of works council formation and authority. The present paper evaluates the new legislation from an economic perspective. We link the crucial terms of the new legislation to extant empirical evidence on the incidence of works councils, the availability of alternative employee involvement mechanisms, and the impact of the institution on performance by establishment size. Given the limitations of the evidence, which are shown to have relaxed the constraints on legislative innovation, we also offer some new empirical findings based on a matched-plants approach, using a nationally representative sample of establishments. This empirical strategy in principle offers improved estimates of the effects of works councils on establishment performance. Although the results of this exercise differ somewhat from earlier analyses, they provide little support for the recent legislative changes.",0,train,170

More precisely, the convergence of the model when the fixed costs tend to zero is investigated. A suitable limit model with purely proportional costs is introduced and an optimal strategy is shown to consist of keeping the risky fraction process in a unique interval $[A,B]\subseteq\,]0,1[$ with minimal effort. Furthermore, the convergence of optimal boundaries, asymptotic growth rates, and optimal risky fraction processes is rigorously proved. The results are based on an in-depth analysis of the convergence of the solutions to the corresponding HJB-equations.",0,train,105

We assume sector specific as well as aggregate ex- ternalities. Moreover, we account for variable capital utilization i.e. the depreciation rate is endogenously determined by the degree of capital ex- ploitation. We show that under mild conditions, multiple equilibria occur. Indeed, following Grandmont, Pintus and de Vilder (JET, 1998), we can identify the necessary conditions for which the economic dynamics does change stability. In our framework, the capital utilization improves the imperfection in production sectors, resulted from the specific and aggre- gate externalities. We show that endogenous fluctuations are more likely to appear as long as the sensitivity of the capital utilization is su¢ ciently high with respect to the capital. Further, this is true for low value of elasticity of factor substitution.",0,train,148

159218840,"This chapter describes practitioners’ understanding of excluding illegally obtained evidence. To gain deeper insight into the applicability of the exclusion of evidence obtained through illegal means and to evaluate regulations that have been implemented, fourteen experts from different legal professions (lawyers, judges, prosecutors) and countries (Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan (ROC)) were interviewed about their experiences. All legal systems are faced with the use of illegally obtained evidence. Based on qualitatively analyzed data the frequency of the applicability of exclusionary rules, the types of cases in which they are seen, and experts’ attitudes towards the function of exclusionary rules are described. Violations of rules around the gathering of evidence is a highly sensitive topic, particularly as the state (represented by police officers and prosecutors) plays a central and powerful role. To find out if exclusionary rules do indeed result in a more impartial trial or if further protective measures are required, factors influencing the procurement of evidence and the decision-making process around the legality of such procurement were evaluated. Subsequently, difficulties that law enforcement agencies and criminal courts are faced with were outlined, with an emphasis on the application of the law and the limitations in safeguarding criminal investigations and proceedings. Concluding remarks highlight best practices in securing a fair trial as well as ancillary measures (including unwritten techniques) that may be utilized to optimize the utility of exclusionary rules.",0,train,230

Now that marriage equality is the law of the land, there is room for a new conversation over the meaning of marriage. Specifically, this essay argues that the proponents of traditional marriage were correct in asserting that the institution of marriage has benefits — intangible and tangible — that no other relationship currently provides to its members. Put another way, although those who defended traditional marriage were wrong with respect to their agenda, what if they in fact were absolutely right in that the marital relationship can provide something quite distinct and of great societal value? After analyzing this proposition, this essay proposes a rethinking of the privacy doctrine. What if the right to be let alone — the prior means by which the citizen is best protected by the State — is in fact more harmful than helpful?

3521476,"A proper immune response ensures survival in a hostile environment and promotes longevity. Recent evidence indicates that innate immunity, beyond antimicrobial effectors, also relies on host-defensive mechanisms. The Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor SKN-1 regulates xenobiotic and oxidative stress responses and contributes to longevity, however, its role in immune defense is unknown. Here we show that SKN-1 is required for C. elegans pathogen resistance against both Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. Exposure to P. aeruginosa leads to SKN-1 accumulation in intestinal nuclei and transcriptional activation of two SKN-1 target genes, gcs-1 and gst-4. Both the Toll/IL-1 Receptor domain protein TIR-1 and the p38 MAPK PMK-1 are required for SKN-1 activation by PA14 exposure. We demonstrate an early onset of immunosenescence with a concomitant age-dependent decline in SKN-1-dependent target gene activation, and a requirement of SKN-1 to enhance pathogen resistance in response to longevity-promoting interventions, such as reduced insulin/IGF-like signaling and preconditioning H2O2 treatment. Finally, we find that wdr-23(RNAi)-mediated constitutive SKN-1 activation results in excessive transcription of target genes, confers oxidative stress tolerance, but impairs pathogen resistance. Our findings identify SKN-1 as a novel regulator of innate immunity, suggests its involvement in immunosenescence and provide an important crosstalk between pathogenic stress signaling and the xenobiotic/oxidative stress response.",0,train,208

In such auctions, incentive-compatibility (IC) means it is best for every agent to honestly report her valuation and fully diffuse the sale information to all her neighbors. Existing work identified some specific mechanisms for diffusion auctions, while a general theory characterizing all incentive-compatible diffusion auctions is still missing.

Drawing on the Community of Practice perspective of knowledge, the second paper draws ideas from organizational behavior to examine the role of open innovation intermediaries in facilitating knowledge collaboration between client organizations and online communities.

By drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives that are under-explored within the literature, this thesis connects open innovation with external research domains, laying the foundation to advance the field toward a sturdier theoretical bent. The insights have practical implications for managers of intermediaries hoping to build client capacity in community-based open innovation.",0,train,203
155365411,"Since climate change threatens human well-being across the globe and into the future, we require a concept of well-being that encompasses an equivalent ambit. This article argues that only a concept of human need can do the work required. It compares need theory with three alternative approaches. Preference satisfaction theory is criticised on the grounds of subjectivity, epistemic irrationality, endogenous and adaptive preferences, the limitlessness of wants, the absence of moral evaluation and the non-specificity of future preferences. The happiness approach is found equally wanting. The main section shows how these deficiencies can be addressed by a coherent theory of need. Human needs are necessary pre-conditions to avoid serious harm and are universalisable, objective, empirically grounded, non-substitutable and satiable. They are broader than ‘material’ needs since a need for personal autonomy figures in all theoretical accounts. Whilst needs are universal, need satisfiers are most often contextual and relative to institutions and cultures. The satiability and non-substitutability of needs is critical for understanding sustainability. Finally, it is argued that human needs provide an indispensable foundation for many current ethical arguments for global and inter-generational justice in the face of threats from climate change. An appendix compares this theory with the capability approaches of Sen and Nussbaum and argues it to be more fundamental.",0,train,212

168793541,"The study attempts to define the dependence between how efficient insolvency proceedings are in particular countries (especially from the perspective of the yields for creditors from these proceedings) and the general level of development of the surveyed countries. This level of development is measured by the data of gross domestic product per inhabitant. The afore-mentioned data was selected on the basis of a hypothesis according to which the GDP per inhabitant in particular captures the ability of a given economic system to create wealth, whilst one of the fundamental prerequisites for such an ability is the general level of enforceability of a contract and therefore also the enforceability of a receivable. Insolvency proceedings as a formally demanding process based on legal specialties (usually an insolvency act) are a suitable representative of the requirement of enforceability of law. The yield for the creditor, then, is understood to be a crucial parameter of the insolvency system, for it is a natural gauge of the result of the enforcement process. Five groups of countries were formed for the purposes of comparison - the most developed European states, post-communist European states already included into the European Union, post-communist European states outside the EU, the most developed economies outside Europe and finally also oil-producing Arab states, where wealth is not necessarily proportional to the quality of enforceability of law. With the aid of regression analysis of the data, the work has proved that the quality of the legal environment measured by the efficiency of insolvency processes is truly related to the general efficiency of the economy. It is thus possible to assert on this foundation that, if we exclude states with exceptional mineral wealth, a high level of enforceability of law too is truly imperative in order to acquire wealth.",0,train,295

The US Department of Defense and US Department of State jointly coordinate over $10 billion of US funding in support for infrastructure development to stimulate and complement the resources of other government and non-government investors and donors. Projects have been identified across four investor/donor organizations but prioritization of investments, especially to achieve regional sustainability, has been a challenge because of the volatile situation and complexities of negotiation among investors and donors. Our effort (i) develops a methodology to prioritize major infrastructure projects under competing assumptions of emergent conditions including security, economic, environmental, workforce, and others, and (ii) demonstrates the methodology with twenty-seven major infrastructure projects of the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan. The effort supports government and nongovernment investors, donors, and stakeholders to make effective investments in Afghanistan infrastructure development under volatile emergent conditions. The effort develops three levels of analysis. In the first level, economic and demographic data are used to prioritize needs for infrastructure development. The second level of the methodology evaluates the impacts of selected projects across fourteen performance criteria derived from the ANDS, highlighting the sensitivity of the impacts to uncertain emergent conditions through an innovative re-weighting of the performance criteria. In the third level, the methodology identifies technical and non-technical requirements and dependencies among projects in a schedule and critical path analysis.

Generally, researchers work on the art of theatre, the rhetoric of the actors, or the dramaturgy built from law cases or from the questions that the law does not completely resolve. Trials, tragedies, even comedies are close: everybody can see the interpenetration of them on stage and in the courts. We know that, and we know that the dramas are made with/from/of law, we know that the art the actors are developing is not so far from the art of the lawyers, and conversely. In this paper, I would like to have a look at the action of the audience, at the session itself and at the way the spectators are here to evaluate and judge not only the dramatic action, not only the art of the actors, not only the text of the author, but also the other spectators, and themselves too. In particular, I will focus on the “common judgment” of the audience and on its judicial, aesthetic and social relationship. The spectators have been undisciplined, noisy, unruled, during such a long period that theatre still retains some prints of this behaviour, even if nowadays, the social and aesthetic rule is to be silent. But uncertainty, inattention, distraction, contradiction, heterogeneity are the notions which characterise the session, and the judgments of the spectators still depend on them. So, what was and what is the voice of the audience? And with what sort of voice do spectators give their judgments?",0,train,249

These effects can be divided into three categories. The first is substantive effects. These include binding, authorizing and (dis)empowering effects. The second category is causative effects, which are the triggering effects that determinations of fact or of law have on substantive effects by bringing them into existence. The third category is modal effects – how and when the substantive effects come into existence (e.g. immediate or deferred, retroactive or non-retroactive, reversible or irreversible effect). Each of these categories of legal effects behaves differently according to whether the effects are intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic effects are based on the special treaty powers of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly. In this hypothesis, all three categories of effects exist to the full extent that the explicit and implicit powers of the adopting body allow for them. Extrinsic effects are directly based on general international law, in particular on the rules of formation of customary international law. Here, there are no causative effects.

Despite the fact that the physical therapy profession trains practitioners to help clients with disabilities to maximize their physical function and teaches them how to adapt to the challenges of daily activity, we initially assumed that a blind student would not be able to complete the program or be able to become a self-sufficient practitioner.

And how is the new concept offered consistent with people empowerment? The revoke of CR-CW in Law 27/2007 is caused that the concept of concession is contrary to the norms of natural resources management in the 1945 Constitution and the spirit of people empowerment. The new concept offered in the Decision is the common access. In this concept of access, CA-SI is regarded as the common property with the rules from members of the community itself. The provisions to access CA-SI as the common property are also determined by agreements of the community itself. Management of CA-SI on the common access is in accordance with people empowerment.

First, it urged the establishment of “safe, disciplined, and alcohol and drugfree schools” that would provide students with the environment conducive to learning and required that schools provide drug and alcohol education as part of a comprehensive health education curriculum (U. S. Department of Education, 1994, p. 3). Secondly, this legislation encouraged the development of “outcomes” or standards that defined what K-12 students should know and be able to do. In fact, one objective of goal three specified that “all students have access to physical education and health education to ensure they are healthy and fit” (p. 1). Student standards for health education were published in 1995 in the National Health Education Standards (Joint Committee on National Health Education Standards, 1995). These seven standards provide performance-based criteria required for meeting specific levels of health education knowledge and skills in elementary, middle-level, and secondary grades.

These work to communicate a compatibility between Islamic precedent and learning sciences abroad. The next section moves to consider whether and how the ‘Franks’ sciences’ connect to their Christianity. I then focus on how al-Ṭahṭāwī categorically portrays those sciences the mission seeks to learn, which he refers to as ʿulūm ḥikmiyya, before turning to concentrate on his presentation of the universal structure of transmitted (naqliyya) and rational (ʿaqliyya) sciences. Together, these two sections show how al-Ṭahṭāwī incorporates and assimilates the Franks' sciences into an Islamic model, restricting these sciences as partial while easing and advocating for their integration into the Islamic lands. The fifth and final section looks more closely at how al-Ṭahṭāwī describes the universal sciences of language alongside the singularity of Arabic in order to draw attention to consequences of al-Ṭahṭāwī's efforts to translate across French and Arabic. In closing I offer a few remarks about how and why al-Ṭahṭāwī frames the Franks' sciences as he does, and suggest how the assimilation of their sciences impacts the greater Islamic structure that absorbs them.",0,train,235

These students and their professors believed the timing was right to argue that indigent litigants involved in the New Jersey domestic violence restraining order process have a legal right to court-appointed counsel as a requirement of equal access to a fair trial. The issue had been briefly raised several years earlier. However, the right to counsel issue had been completely disregarded by the courts, and no state-based advocacy groups pursued the issue. These students, in contrast, saw something to the issue that other advocates had missed. Moreover, they saw it at the right time in their own legal education to act on it, compellingly. The article offers a rhetorical analysis of what they wrote, what happened, and the impact on advocacy in New Jersey domestic violence law.",0,train,241
154846430,"This paper considers an overlapping generations model of economic growth populated by two types of individuals. Competitive types compare future consumption (i.e. wealth) with the mean. Self-sufficient types derive utility simply from their own consumption and do not compare themselves with others. I derive a condition under which the utility (happiness) of both types increases when the economy is populated by a larger share of competitive types. In the long-run the condition is always fulfilled when the economy is capable of economic growth. The reason for this phenomenon is that competitive types generate higher savings and thus higher aggregate capital stock and income per capita, which raises utility of both types. I show that the result is robust to the consideration of endogenous work effort and that a sufficiently high share of competitive types in a society can be inevitable for long-run economic growth to exist.",0,train,146

This study examines the perception of relationships between staff and students in the application of security measures in secondary schools and the setbacks between teachers and students in the enforcement of educational policy in schools. This study looks at the situation in two Local Government Areas in the Riverine area of Rivers State, Nigeria where the story is the same in terms of the safety and security of school children. This study found fear among students and staff, anxiety, uncertainty, low morale, and absenteeism as a result of bullying and violence. This study identified a number of challenges, which include the absence of electricity, the uncooperative attitude of some Nigerians towards innovation, and lack of funds. This paper echoes the voices of concerned Nigerians and notes that if stringent measures are not put in place to ensure safety in schools, Nigeria risks not producing the men and women it needs (with adequate skills and education) to guide the country in the coming years. This study recommends that federal, state and local governments have emergency notification systems mounted in strategic locations in schools.

144119917,"Abstract This article examines changing configurations of regional conflict in south-west Ethiopia around the Suri people, a “beleaguered” ethnic group of about 24–25,000 people living on the Sudanese–Ethiopian border. The question will be asked around why the Suri, a small agro-pastoral people at the margins of state power centres, failed to develop solutions to growing problems of group conflict, challenges of state policy, the spread of small arms (since the late 1980s), and the lack of forming new local alliances with neighbouring groups. Social and cultural effects of violence are fragmenting Suri society and their regional position is weakened, in contrast to, for instance, the Nyangatom or Anywaa, neighbouring ethnic groups of comparable size, but who are more successful in the ethno-federal political structure of post-1991 Ethiopia. In addition, while the Suri are affected by new globalizing influences like tourism and evangelical Christianity, there is only a very slow movement towards, respectiv...",0,train,152

Intelligent tutoring has been deployed for well-defined and relatively static educational domains such as algebra and geometry. However, this adaptive approach to computer-based training has yet to come into wider usage for domains that are less well defined or where student-system interactions are less structured, such as during scenario-based simulation and immersive serious games. In order to address how to expand the reach of adaptive training technology to these domains, leading experts in the field present their work in areas such as student modeling, pedagogical strategy, knowledge assessment, natural language processing, and virtual human agents. Several approaches to designing adaptive technology are discussed for both traditional educational settings and professional training domains. This book will appeal to anyone concerned with educational and training technology at a professional level, including researchers, training systems developers, and designers.",0,train,149

The rapid commercialization of the press, together with an increase in literacy and political consciousness, has led to swift growth in the newspaper market but also changed the way news makers mediate politics. Positioned at a historical junction where India is clearly feeling the effects of market liberalization, this study demonstrates how journalists and informants interactively create new forms of political action and consciousness. The book explores English and Hindi newsmaking and investigates the creation of news relations during the production process and how they affect political images and leadership traditions. It moves beyond the news-room to outline the role of journalists in urban society, the social lives of news texts and the way citizens bring their ideas and desires to bear on the news discourse. This important volume contributes to an emerging debate about the impact of the media on Indian society. Furthermore, it convincingly demonstrates the inseparable link between media related practices and dynamic cultural repertoires.

145420740,"This article offers a sympathetic appraisal of Erich Fromm’s conceptualisation of narcissism as it relates to the emergence, sustenance, and resolution of authoritarian violence. The discussion is first placed within the methodological debate over the analytic operations that are required for an adequate understanding of authoritarian violence, explaining why a psychoanalytic perspective is necessary. The focus then shifts to Fromm’s take on the Freudian concept of narcissism, before proceeding to explore in some depth his account of the symbolic mechanisms and contextual climate that must combine in practice in order for narcissistic energies to be channeled into authoritarianism and violence. Attention in this regard is paid both to the populace and governing elites. The article concludes with a short exposition of Fromm’s notion of benign narcissism, from its specific content to the conditions of its possibility.

19920037,"Abstract When a fish stock shifts from one nation to another nation, e.g., due to climate change, the nation that loses the resource has incentives to deplete it, while the other nation, receiving the resource, has incentives to conserve it. We propose an analytical model to study under which circumstances self-enforcing agreements can align incentives. Our setup allows to distinguish between a fast and a slow shift and between a smooth or a sudden shift in ownership. We show that the shorter the expected duration of the transition, the higher the total equilibrium exploitation rate. Similarly, a sudden shift implies—by and large—more aggressive non-cooperative exploitation than a gradual shift. However, a self-enforcing agreement without side-payments is more likely for a sudden than for a smooth shift. Further, the scope for cooperation increases with the expected duration of the transition, and it decreases with the renewability of the resource and the discount rate. Most importantly, we show that concentrating on in-kind transfers can be very detrimental for shifting renewable resources: In some cases, there is no efficient bargaining solution without side-payments, even when there are only two players.",0,train,187

Investment in outside options is a prime example of such opportunism and often leads to inefficiency, for example by exerting effort to search for alternative business partners even if it does not add trade value. We experimentally investigate a bilateral trade relationship in which standard theory assuming self-regarding preferences predicts that the seller will be better off by investing in the outside option to improve his bargaining position. The seller’s investment, however, might negatively affect the buyer’s other-regarding preferences if the investment is viewed as opportunistic. We find overall support for our hypotheses that arise from the link between other-regarding behavior and opportunism. Our findings suggest that when the transaction cost economics approach is applied to the design of a governance structure, other regarding preferences, if relevant, should be taken into account.",0,train,150

From these eleven common terms, a trader has to choose the Incoterm that is most appropriate for the specific transaction he wishes to engage in.

According to the ICC, maritime terms are not appropriate, and thus should not be used in container trade, as the seller does not ‘deliver’ the container on board the vessel, but most often hands over the goods to the carrier at an inland point or terminal.

Non-trivial cases involve individuals that enter the simulation with a history of previous outcomes. We show that the simple solutions of attributing to these individuals a null effect or a random draw from the estimated unconditional distributions lead to biased forecasts, which are often worse than those obtained neglecting unobserved heterogeneity altogether.

Specifically, I critically investigate the intersecting social and medical elements of responses to bodies perceived as too thin and otherwise lacking in physical ability, using my own experiences of living and aging with cystic fibrosis (CF) as a case example. In these explorations, I center gendered identity and its intersection with disabling physical illness. I do so by using my own lived experiences as autoethnographic anchor points to guide critical review of key concepts from the nexus of these two content areas. I focus throughout on exploring how others’ reactions to a frail-looking body often constitute a form of forced gendering via the narratives people attempt to construct for why a person’s body appears that way. The title of the manuscript supports this framework by referencing three cornerstones of patient experience in the CF community: the general trend of patients having salty skin due to the pathology of the disease, a prior embodiment project called Salty Girls (Pettigrew, 2012) that engages this idea, and the more abstract concept of “saltiness” in describing the grit marginalized people display in responding to microaggressions.",0,train,208

Using backcasting as a policy tool for developing a view of a sustainable energy future, this Chapter aims to explore some of the critical hurdles as the policy makers continue to formulate and advance environmentally friendly energy consumption in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change. We illustrate the nature of the challenges to reach a wider adoption of alternative energy resources and build on the need for renewal of the energy “delivery” infrastructure through the “smart grid” as a means for transition to a sustainable economy in the longer term. While there is now engagement with the public about a sustainable future, alignment of stakeholders’ economic interests and absorption capacity of emerging technologies remain as the two main challenges in mitigating the underlying systemic hurdles to be overcome. As the public at large realize the need for a future of sustainable energy despite lack of a global consensus about definitive targets, the policy makers may seek to provide a combination of approaches that build on optimal investment incentives in the near-term, liberalization of the electricity grids in the medium term and a dynamic policy framework that induce continuous technological innovation in the longer term. Observing the current responses to the externalities by the policymakers in a number of jurisdictions we articulate such forthcoming initiatives to mitigate the systemic hurdles embedded in the existing energy infrastructure. We also articulate measures to enable deployment of integrative sustainable energy solutions over a transformed infrastructure, namely smart grid.",0,train,289

We estimate a vector autoregession to examine the joint behavior of returns, cash-flow news, and trading between individuals and institutions. Our main finding is that institutions buy shares from individuals in response to good cash-flow news, thus exploiting the underreaction phenomenon. Institutions are not simply following price momentum strategies: When price goes up in the absence of positive cash-flow news, institutions sell shares to individuals. Although institutions are trading in the 'right' direction, institutions as a group outperform individuals by only 1.44 percent per annum before transaction and other costs, because they are extremely conservative in deviating from the value-weight market index.",0,train,138

Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was a perfect opportunity for America to accomplish this — to raise America's image from the ashes of despair, self- doubt, and low credibility in the world. After the invasion, President Saddam Hussein was ejected out of obscurity into the light of world curiosity and intrigue. Seen as the leader who dared to steal an entire country in daylight, who took hostages and created human shields, and then arrogantly brushed aside the world's outrage, the entire world seemed to want to understand not Saddam's politics, but his mind. As the world threatened Hussein with ejection from Kuwait, he not only grandiosely retorted with threats of burning the entire planet, but became increasingly brazen, emboldened, dangerous, and resolute. Saddam's self organization fuels the “Nebuchadnezzar Imperial Complex,” which operate within the malignant narcissistic paranoid personality. The Iraqi leader's dynamics dovetailed with “Gulf- Nam” — the American post- Vietnam failure syndrome.

156296326,"Following the beginning of the financial crises in 2008, the Federal Reserve introduced a number of new monetary policy tools. It was aimed at supporting the functioning of financial markets during the crisis and helping the economy recover from the recession by altering both the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. These new policy tools came as a last resort when traditional policy tool, such as, the federal funds rate target was already constrained near zero. This new policy tool – called “quantitative easing” – is comprised of (a) lending to financial institutions, (b) providing liquidity to key markets, and (c) purchasing longer-term securities. While the first two were aimed at lowering the short-term lending rates, the third one was aimed at lowering the long-term lending rates. Lowering of the lending rates was expected to raise consumer and business spending and, thereby, stimulate the economy. There have been studies on the effect of this new policy tool on various aspects of domestic and international economies. However, none has evaluated the policy’s effect on U.S. balance of trade. Our study develops a model of the balance of trade, which is a function of domestic (U.S.) and foreign real GDPs, exchange rate of U.S. dollar, and monetary policy (credit easing) dummy. We then empirically test the model on a panel data for the U.S. and BRICS countries over the period, 1995 – 2014, and find that the Fed’s quantitative easing has no effect, whatsoever, on U.S. balance of trade. This finding although seems counterintuitive but is logical. This is because, the BRICS countries’ economic growth is mainly export driven. Therefore, a rise (fall) in their GDP means a rise (fall) in their exports, that is a rise (fall) in U.S. imports from these countries causing a fall (rise) in U.S. balance of trade. This negative effect of BRICS countries’ real GDP on U.S. balance of trade was offset by the positive effect of lowered value of the U.S. dollar – caused by the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing – leaving the U.S. balance of trade unaffected.",0,train,346

The study presented in this paper uses a novel “Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces” (CCF) model developed in the context of global new product development projects, to examine the way that the interaction of factors relevant to project management contributes to successful ERP implementation processes. Based on regression analysis of responses from 244 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms in Taiwan and China collected in May 2006, we find that the balance of centrifugal and centripetal forces fosters ERP project success, a result which has significant impacts on ERP project management practice. The study also opens up a new direction for future research on ERP implementation processes in that it suggests a novel way to model the interaction of project management factors. In addition, the new measures regarding project success and project management developed and validated in this study should prove to be useful for researchers studying ERP implementation processes.",0,train,172
54653258,"Design law has gained increased topicality since the implementation of the Directive on the legal protection of designs (the ""Directive"") in the law of the Member States, and the enactment of the Regulation on Community designs (the ""Regulation""). The Regulation introduced, in addition to the Community registered design right (""CRDR""), a Community unregistered design right (""CUDR"") which is very similar to the CRDR. The CUDR came into force on 6 March 2002. It is in part based on the British invention of the unregistered design right or design right (""UDR""). Before the introduction of the CUDR, this type of right did not exist anywhere else in Europe. While the registered design right (""RDR"") existed in Great Britain since the 18th century, the British legislature only introduced UDR in 1988 while reforming the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (""CDPA""); the UDR entered into force on 1 August 1989. Thus, it is a relatively new right compared to traditional intellectual property rights. Is the British UDR remote from the new CUDR as introduced by the Community lawmaker? The object of this article is to compare the main features of the UDR and the CUDR, in particular focusing on the requirements for protection and infringement, in order to evaluate whether or not the UDR will survive the CUDR, or whether the new CUDR will erase the UDR from the legal landscape, and whether UDR case law will influence future Community design courts case law.

144200808,"In their 1993 essay on diaspora and identity, Daniel and Jonathan Boyarin reject “diaspora” as a site of persecution and fear and instead argue that “the [new] lesson of Diaspora, namely, that peoples and lands are not naturally and organically connected . . . can teach us that it is possible for a people to maintain its distinctive culture, its difference, without controlling land, a fortiori without controlling other people.” I argue that the Boyarins’ new “diaspora” has been incorporated into contemporary Jewish American humor and provides assimilated Jews a way to create humor in a multicultural world. The Boyarins’ diasporic thinking can be applied to diverse contemporary Jewish comedic texts like Roth’s “The Conversion of the Jews,” Englander’s “What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank,” and Auslander’s Hope, A Tragedy. Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, and Larry David also reject traditional forms of Jewish comedy (the need for group identity and solidarity in the face of suffering, persecution, genocide, powerlessness) in favor of an emancipated diaspora that maintains identity while it is outer directed and engages the Other. Although Jewish “diaspora” humor is traditionally associated with disenfranchisement, vulnerability and persecution, Daniel and Jonathan Boyarin view it as an opportunity for an increasingly powerful Jewish identity that benefits from what was once a liability: diaspora or geographical dis persion. By separating communal identity from land acquisition, Jews are able to maintain a sense of group particularity without the domination of the Other, thereby substituting cultural collaboration for confrontation. This version of diasporic thinking complements American egalitarianism at the same time that it expands the scope and affect of traditional Jewish humor. Although, in 1951, Irving Howe could not imagine how the traditional Jewish humor of the embattled European diaspora would translate into an enfranchised, empowered American idiom, I argue that in the hands of Philip Roth, Nathan Englander, and Shalom Auslander as well as popular artists like Jerry Seinfeld, Woody Allen, Larry David, and others, a new form of Jewish diasporic humor is not only thriving in America but",0,train,341

Several technologies have been mobilised in a large scale that had not been predicted to play any significant role.

Therefore, calls for CDM reform have gained strength. An analysis of the CDM project portfolio shows that Least Developed Countries and Africa have so far been sidelined. However, more small-scale projects have been submitted than expected from theoretical analyses of project cycle transaction cost, maybe due to high CER price expectations and a high share of unilateral projects. While developing country companies have been able to capture almost half of the CDM consultancy market, they have not made an inroad into validation and verification. The concentration of host countries has increased. Development benefits of CDM projects are often limited, especially of the large projects destroying industrial gases.

As part of this community, maintaining a connection with program alumni is vital for assessing the achievement of the program educational objectives.

There are a variety of reasons why the political environment might influence Latinos’ partisan choice. First, a substantial proportion of the adult Latino population in the United States is foreign-born, potentially lessening the influence of parental partisan socialization. Second, increased migration to areas outside the Southwest has exposed Latinos to new and different social, political, and economic environments. Using subgroup analysis, interactive logit models, and regression discontinuity, we find that the local political context influences the party attachment of Latino immigrants in predictable ways.

152997167,"Abstract : This thesis explains the military relationship between the United States and Pakistan in the context of their divergent national security interests. During the Cold War, U.S. concerns focused on the global contest between democracy and communism. In this competition Pakistan was seen as an important ally. However, Pakistan viewed India as it primary threat and considered global ideological concerns as secondary in importance. At times, each country benefited from the other, but neither ever fully met the other's most important needs. The United States did not support Pakistan in its wars with India and Pakistan did not confront communism except to help oust Afghani governments non-compliant with Pakistan's interests. Pakistan's military held power for more than half of Pakistan's existence and became the U.S. key ally in South Asia. Pakistan's pursuit of nuclear weapons distanced U.S. relations in the post-Cold War environment. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 catapulted Pakistan's importance as an ally but at the cost of supporting a military regime and the erosion of a democratic government in Pakistan. This thesis argues that Pakistan's military now shares a relationship with the United States that builds regional stability but which may also hold political consequences in the United States.",0,train,204

The article draws upon recent scholarship regarding the international legal agreements adopted in 1924 (the London Accords) and 1925 (the Locarno Accords) to demonstrate their potential for a new form of European and international stability. This potential, however, remained constrained by the logic and limitations of the primacy of State sovereignty. Within this context, Kelsen’s Lecture sought to set the emerging international order within a unified legal framework of national and international positive law.

This study discusses the male dominance phenomenon through domestic violence in patriarchal society. It positions woman as a secondary level to man. The implications of woman as the “other” and the secondary level are discussed using feminism theory by Simone de Beauvoir and using the Sexual Politics by Kate Millet as the supporting theory. The methodology that is used is qualitative textual analysis in order to analyze the narrative and non-narrative aspects as data of analysis to carry out the ideological meaning within the film. The aim of the analysis is to portray the domestic violence in the forms of physical violence, psychological or emotional abuse, sexual violence, and threat of physical or sexual violence perpetrated by Chuck Traynor that show the male dominance by patriarchal society. It also aims to show the existing portrayal of the sex industry and depict Linda’s struggle in dealing with domestic violence and the enslavement of the sex industry. However, the male dominance can happen because of traditional gender stereotypes and the term second sex victimizes the woman as sexual exploitation of man and tends to make woman struggles. By focusing on male dominance that occurred could highlight the issue of domestic violence experienced by woman in the film with its effects toward woman in order to reduce the number of domestic violence and gender discrimination in every field. The portrayal of the enslavement of the sex industry as a patriarchal product also shows how woman is treated as a sexual objectification which portrays her as a weak and submissive creature.",0,train,307

60505371,"In 2013, the Kansas State Book Network’s Common Read program marked its fourth year by selecting Ernest Cline’s dystopian novel Ready Player One. From the program’s inception, Kansas State University Libraries (KSUL) participated in the Common Read program through activities such as hosting book displays, integrating elements of the books into face-toface instruction sessions, and creating LibGuides. In addition to these activities, for 2013’s Common Read two librarians and an instructional designer decided to try something previously attempted by only a handful of colleges and universities: build a campus-wide transmedia storytelling event that not only embedded literacy instruction into the heart of the Common Read program, but also captured the imaginations, interests, and talents of close to 600 students, faculty, and staff.",0,train,122
23381419,"Based on recent studies regarding the advantages of flapless immediate implants on the maintenance of the soft tissue architecture (especially at papillae level) in those situations where it is necessary to extract an anterior tooth, this case report describes a clinical procedure designed to replace a hopeless central incisor (2.1) showing root resorption adjacent to an implant-supported crown (1.1), whose gingival margin is 2 mm coronal regarding the hopeless tooth to be replaced. After the extraction of the hopeless tooth (2.1), a flapless immediate implant was placed. The implant-bone gap was then filled with bone substitute and a palatal connective tissue graft was placed ad modum saddle extending at buccal level from apical to the mucogingival line, sealing the socket and extending until 6 mm at palatal level ad modum saddle. This procedure allowed symmetry of the soft tissue margins between the two implants (1.1 and 2.1) to be obtained as well as the preservation of the inter-implant papillae (1.1).",0,train,160

On questions of Bosnia and Kosovo, Serbia's policy capacity is weakened by lack of domestic consensus on whether Belgrade should embrace East or West on Balkan security issues. Nonalignment may be one way out of this dilemma; a second avenue might be a stronger role for the Contact Group comprising the United States, Russia, and key European Union countries. A continued policy of drift at the mercy of events seems risky for Serbia over the longer term.",0,train,102

23140030,"Now that the sequencing of the human genome has been completed, the basic challenges are finding the genes, locating their coding regions and predicting their functions. This will result in a new understanding of human biology as well as in the design of new molecular structures as potential novel diagnostic or drug discovery targets. The assessment of gene function may be performed using the tools of the genome program. These tools represent high-throughput methods used to evaluate changes in the expression of many or all genes of an organism at the same time in order to investigate genetic pathways for normal development and disease. This will lead to a shift in the scientific paradigm: In the pre-proteomics era, functional assignments were derived from hypothesis-driven experiments designed to understand specific cellular processes. The new tools describe proteins on a proteome-wide scale, thereby creating a new way of doing cell research which results in the determination of three-dimensional protein structures and the description of protein networks. These descriptions may then be used for the design of new hypotheses and experiments in the traditional physiological, biochemical and pharmacological sense. The evaluation of genetically manipulated animals or newly designed biomolecules will require a thorough understanding of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology and the experimental approaches will involve many new technologies, including in vivo imaging with single-photon emission tomography and positron emission tomography. Nuclear medicine procedures may be applied for the determination of gene function and regulation using established and new tracers or using in vivo reporter genes such as enzymes, receptors, antigens or transporters. Pharmacogenomics will identify new surrogate markers for therapy monitoring which may represent potential new tracers for imaging. Also, drug distribution studies for new therapeutic biomolecules are needed, at least during preclinical stages of drug development. Finally, new biomolecules will be developed by bioengineering methods which may be used for isotope-based diagnosis and treatment of disease.",0,train,314
157040758,"While supply chain scholars have made considerable progress in theory building and testing, there has been a relative dearth of middle range theory. Middle-range theory (MRT) is context-specific conceptualization providing theoretically grounded insights readily applicable to an empirical context. It promotes rigorous and relevant research, bridges practice and theory, and conveys deeper understanding of how and why phenomena occur. The lack of significant MRT is surprising given the considerable efforts supply chain scholars exert to stay grounded in industry practices. As a result, the authors put forth a broad call for more middle-range theorizing and provide guidance on how supply chain scholars may meet this call. Specifically, they describe a MRT lever—theoretical contextualization—that strikes a balance between theory and industry and then present two overarching strategies (bottom-up and top-down) for MRT development. The authors discuss these strategies in the supply chain domain and identify how middle-range theorizing may be undertaken in four emerging, yet important, topics.",0,train,156
154495635,"In the 20th century advanced industrial countries of the West faced with the challenge of providing full economic, political and civil rights to the millions of post-Second World War migrant workers and their families. The challenge was twofold: For the host countries the challenge was how to accept migrant workers as permanent settlers and provide their integration into the host country‟s economic, social and political system 1 . For the migrant workers the challenge was how to achieve social justice, respect and fair treatment for themselves and their families without having to pay an unacceptable price in terms of compromising their national identities and cultural heritage 2 . This study investigates how this twofold problem was handled within the tradition of Scandinavian welfare state. An analysis of the solutions offered by the Scandinavian countries in the form of humanitarian and generous policies and practices towards migrant workers may provide a good example to other countries struggling with the same problem.",0,train,160
155905150,"People with dementia often undergo profound changes in attitudes and behavior. Following such changes it can be difficult for carers to know whether or not to apply advance directives: should the person’s apparent current choices be respected or should they be overridden by choices that were made before the dementia developed? This question raises further questions about the nature of autonomy and identity and how these are affected by the various kinds of functional damage caused by dementia. Ronald Dworkin answered this question by arguing that identity is based around what he terms “critical interests” and that these interests are formed prior to the onset of dementia, which means that prior decisions should be applied. Agnieszka Jaworska has criticized this view and argued that people with dementia retain the capacity to form new critical interests because they retain the capacity to value.

199152340,"In this paper, five authors account for the rethinking of a conference as a series of postcards, letters, rules and silent moments so that traditional hierarchies of knowledge could be overturned or, at least, sidelined. We recount how the place we convened was enlisted as an actor and the dramas and devices we applied to encounter it. We use this accounting to problematize the conventional practices of goal-oriented meetings and co-authored papers as forms of academic meaning-making. In finding a meeting point where expertise was disorientated and status undressed, we were able to investigate the idea of co-being between human and nonhuman realities as the step social theory needs to take to become a point of connection with the social world, instead of an escape from it. We conclude that this involved silence and necessary fictions as a means to consider the future and past in the moment of meeting.",0,train,150

To most people even the educators, the term adult education evokes an image of night classes at the local high school or perhaps another activity prominently labeled as such. The purpose of this article is not to dwell on what people perceive adult education to be, but rather to look at the nature and the approaches that are used in the study of comparative education. It is important to explain first the following concepts: Comparative, Adult Education, Comparative Education and Comparative Adult Education. After defining these concepts, the paper proceeds to discuss some of the approaches that are very relevant to the study of comparative education. These approaches are by nature historical, scientific, sociological, philosophical and methodological. The paper then concludes with a discussion on what comparative adult education is, and what it should aim at in the years ahead.",0,train,157
